		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A book becomes a textbook when it's authored by someone who isn't your teacher. It's a very different dynamic when the teacher is the one giving the guidance. This is why we've openly licensed this resource. We want instructors to have the freedom to customize the introduction. Maybe your metaphor for reading isn't The Station as we've envisioned it, but something else. Maybe the units and assignments focus on aspects of literature other than the narrative elements we've used to structure assignments. We'd love to hear what you've done with this text--please let us know and we'll include a link to your adaptation at the bottom of this page!

This course focuses on the long nineteenth century, but it could be adapted to any historical survey by showing students how to find texts they’ve never read that fall in the period being studied (perhaps even encouraging them to explore texts beyond those most commonly assigned). For a course focusing on a specific genre or literary movement, this same approach can work. The trick to eliminating the reading list is figuring out how to help students find new-to-them texts in the period, genre, or movement being studied. These classifications are interpretive (does it matter most when a text was originally published or when it experienced a resurgence in popularity?); we expect that fuzzy boundaries can be very productive to this method.

Assignments in this course asked students to compose posts for a website that was only visible to members of the class during the semester. Students were able to choose whether they wanted to share discussion reflections and formal assignments with the instructor or the entire class. As seen in the final project options below, the course website also allowed students to prepare their writing to be fully public at the end of the semester. This option for students to share their writing with classmates is an important feature of the course. The website also makes it possible for the instructor to read what students are thinking at the end of class discussions (and emphasize the importance of participation by giving credit for reflections as complete or incomplete). Discussion reflections reveal where students are getting stuck (things they might not volunteer during discussion).

In this course, we encourage students to think of literary techiques/forms/inventions as tools that help humans respond to environmental problems. We think that literary scholarship has only started to identify these tools in the available literature and that students can participate in this process, perhaps alerting us to techniques we haven’t yet encountered. Our primary goal is to help students prepare to explore new works of literature for the rest of their lives.

Literature courses differ based on the techniques of explanation, discussion, and independent work that an instructor uses. This course departs from many longstanding techniques within these three realms to try something new.

1. Instead of facilitating interpretation-based discussion of a shared text, instructors help students learn how to articulate their experiences reading texts they have chosen. This puts students in the position of ownership of their reading. The instructor has an opportunity to volunteer interesting context or interpretive possibilities the student might not be aware of when offering feedback on assignments.
2. Instead of instructors contextualizing assigned reading with historical context or the explanation of formal features, students are given the responsibility of finding these things on their own. Instructor expertise is much more important in this process because they are drawing on their knowledge of literary history on the fly or modeling their own research process when they’re not sure of the answer (which will be a common occurrence!). This change can happen primarily because we now live in an era of knowledge abundance. The context for understanding texts is not only available to the professor to be disseminated to students through a lecture.
3. Instead of producing papers of literary analysis, students chronicle their reading experiences and their process of identifying features and literary techniques that prompted their reactions. We have set aside “English paper” assignments because we see literature instruction as distinct from writing instruction. The teaching of logic and other tools of academic argumentation is valuable and happens in writing courses. To assess student learning in the realm of literature, we are not testing them on how well they can recall specific texts, contexts, ad themes. Instead, we ask them to make sense of a text they’ve never encountered before and assess how efficiently they’re taking advantage of resources to make sense of the unfamiliar.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Course Description:</strong> This course is an opportunity to explore the literature of the nineteenth century, a time of great social change and many wonderful genres. Between the revolutionary wars of the late eighteenth century and the the first world war at the start of the twentieth is a complex period that can feel similar to our own and wildly unfamiliar at the same time. Reading literature produced in this period can take you in many different directions. Much of the genre fiction popular today emerged in this period (science fiction, detective stories, and vampire novels to name a few). Fandoms formed around suspenseful novels published serially in periodicals. Photography and moving pictures were invented at this time, making the theatrical history of the period relevant to any film buff. And, of course, there are the novels. They are big. They are brilliant. You might want to read one (probably not two). The possibilities are limitless. I'll help you find "new-to-you" things to read and we'll work together to make sense of your experiences with the literature of this fascinating period.

</div>
<h1>Welcome to the Station (in-class activity)</h1>
<em>This piece,<a id="welcometothestation"></a> which I read aloud on the first day of class, is an effort to help students grasp the power of narrative by imagining a transportation hub in which you can go anywhere you want by simply speaking the name of your chosen destination into a magical window. It encourages students to imagine their own version of this station and then introduces the paradox of choice in the Internet age, which has given rise to recommender systems that remove the dilemma of making a choice (and steal autonomy in the process). Many students appreciate this opportunity to listen and imagine, but some have shared that closing their eyes makes it harder to envision what I'm describing. I bring hard copies so students can read along if they want.</em>

In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Closing your eyes can make it easier to imagine the space, but you can also read along if you think that will work better.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a transportation hub filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Villette.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Villette.

Now the glass is glass again. See? (tap tap tap). You can tap it too if you want.

Oh, and if you look quickly across the station in that back corner you can see a whole family leaping together through a window! You can absolutely go on a journey with other people.

It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make-believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that you find wonderful. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. I used a window, but what will you use as a portal? Remember, through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. Trust me, I get it. And I’ll just mention (because I think it will put your mind somewhat at ease) you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Preparation and Participation</h1>
I think class discussion is one of the most important elements of this course and it works best if we all come prepared. You should prepare for each class by selecting something specific you want to bring into the discussion (this might be something you've read or something you've written, depending on the moment in the semester). Before the start of class, I’ll ask each of you to add things you want to discuss to Our Doc (a shared Word Online document). As we begin discussion, I’ll ask you to put devices away and get out your notebooks. I will do my best on the class computer to pull up texts, passages, and random things that come up as the discussion happens. I’ll also give you time at the end of class to compose a discussion reflection on our course website. You should use this as an opportunity to share what you took away from the discussion, whether you voiced your ideas during class or not. Your goal is to write quickly and informally to capture emerging ideas. By the end of the allotted time (or a bit after class if you need more time), I will ask you to publish your post or keep it private (I’ll be able to see it either way). In the gradebook, I will give you a completion grade for your preparation work (added to Our Doc) and for your participation work (entered as a discussion reflection).
<h1>Getting Started (Assignment #1)</h1>
For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select a story that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. Making such a selection can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust me, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Beowulf</em> and from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Bridgerton</em>) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers, etc.) who draw on an ever-expanding set of narrative technologies as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore something you have genuinely enjoyed. Once you’ve put a name to the experiences you’ve had with stories in the past, you can find more stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences (and remember, that’s the point of this assignment).

Once you’ve decided on the story you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right setup to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements for this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the narrative technology the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any other assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think one or more stories work. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). It’s unlikely you’ll figure everything out, and that’s okay. If you do find a source that offers an explanation (like an article or a blog post), make sure to cite it!
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe your Experience</strong></h2>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. If possible, include who or what introduced you to the story. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year. Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced when you encountered the story.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Classify Your Experience</strong></h2>
Now that you’ve described your experience, you’re going to consider whether others have had that same experience with a story. This might be a little challenging because it’s not what we typically do with literature in a classroom. You might be expecting to <em>interpret</em> literature in a course like this, perhaps using class discussion to debate the meaning of Frankenstein’s relationship with the monster he created in Mary Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>.

But with this assignment, I’m not asking you to find out if someone has interpreted the story you’ve chosen in the same way you have. Instead, I’m asking you to determine if others have had a similar experience <em>with any work of literature</em>. You can see in the example experiences below that an experience is different than an interpretation (and wildly different works of literature can prompt similar experiences):
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table class="has-fixed-layout">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Confusion</td>
<td>The feeling of being bewildered or unclear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection</td>
<td>Feeling linked or bonded to others in community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Courage</td>
<td>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Curiosity</td>
<td>When we feel we have some idea about an answer, but are unconfident about what that answer is. The active form of wonder. Where the first form of wonder is passive (essentially pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you), curiosity is active.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>The feeling of understanding another person’s actions. You may not condone the actions or identify with the person, but you accept that their actions weren’t wrong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wonder</td>
<td>An uplifting emotional experience of discovery. As Fletcher puts it, wonder is “life through the eyes of a child” (16). It is like pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you (84).</td>

You can peruse the full list of experiences we’ve classified so far in the <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/back-matter/experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiences Glossary</a>.

Instead of interpreting, we’re going to use a scientific method similar to what biologists use when they work from observations in the field toward taxonomic classification of species. If they observe an organism that hasn’t already been classified, they get to name a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). But they might find that what they’ve observed is not a new species (it’s actually just a funny-looking zebra). We’ll discuss new experiences as a class, helping you determine if you’ve actually had a new experience or found a funny-looking zebra. If the experience you had isn’t in the list above, you can give it a name and, if you want, <a href="https://forms.newhaven.edu/view.php?id=379445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propose it for inclusion in WonderCat</a> so it can be represented in our list of experiences going forward.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe the Features Prompting your Experience</strong></h2>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features, so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld, for example), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible. Here are examples of direction quotation and paraphrase:

Direct quotation from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

“My rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow…I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.”

Paraphrase from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

The story is presented from a variety of narrative perspectives: the explorer, Dr. Frankenstein, and his monster.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try to Determine the Narrative Technology That Created the Feature</strong></h2>
As you try to figure out which features of the story prompted your experience, try also to imagine the narrative technology the author used to create those features. I say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to remember that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your experience and who is most likely responsible for it? Below, I describe the four basic elements of narrative (you can click to look at narrative technologies in each category)
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#storyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Character</strong></h3>
This is pretty straightforward. These are the characters doing things in the story. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some character technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!

Once you’ve done your best to identify the technology that prompted your experience, you’re done! Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technology linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore in this assignment (I’d suggest no more than three). You can organize your post according to the steps outlined above, as I’ve done in my example post, or you can write a post that includes all that information but presents it in a way that you think will be more compelling to your classmates. You have the option to share your post with your classmates or keep it private so I’m the only one who sees it.

<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on Assignment #1)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Introducing WonderCat</h1>
So, now you’ve done assignment one.<a id="introducingwondercat"></a> You’ve described the emotional experiences prompted by a story that has been meaningful in your life. Maybe you’ve identified specific narrative technologies that prompted your experiences. Good work. Now it’s time to go back to The Station. Before we go back, though, let’s think a little about our first visit to The Station. Because that was a story.

I created The Station to function as a metaphor. I wanted you to feel a sense of wonder as I described a magical place that could take you on a journey anywhere without buying a ticket, going through security, or waiting at a departure gate. In this metaphor I created, I took the act of experiencing a story and stretched it into an actual journey. I’m not the first person to do this, and most people respond to The Station by telling me that it reminded them of platform 9 ¾ in <em>Harry Potter</em> or another fantastical story in which characters could teleport to another place with relative ease. In my version, whispering the name of the place you want to go into a window is like saying the name of the story you want to experience, whether that’s opening up a book and reading the first line, pressing play to start a film, or sitting in a theater as the lights dim and the actors emerge onto the stage.

But like all metaphors, mine glosses over some of the realities. It is true that the Internet makes it possible for you to access a digital version of almost any book in the world in a matter of seconds. But not everyone knows that this is possible (you often don’t even have to go to the library to access their books!). And of course, not everyone has access to the Internet. Accessing a book is slightly more challenging than walking up to a window and whispering a destination, but I still marvel at the magic of libraries. They may not have everything, but they can get almost anything if you ask.

In addition to this feeling of wonder, I also wanted you to feel a bit of the inevitable anxiety that emerges when your options are so open. Humans have not always had near-immediate access to so many stories. In the earliest universities, only the professor (then called a master) had access to the texts he was teaching. A significant part of teaching in the medieval period involved making a text available so students could create a copy, complete with notes on the relevant contexts that they could also only learn directly from the master. But you don’t need to be in a university to access literature now, nor do you need a master to tell you the historical context necessary to make sense of unfamiliar texts. You can read anything, watch anything, play anything. The options are endless! And that is delightful. But also overwhelming. This class is meant to help you make the most of your near-infinite access to literature. And so, let’s go back to The Station to think through this metaphorically. Please get out a sheet of paper. Close those eyes or read along. Let’s go back through the radiator.

I want us to visit The Station again to explore a shop designed to help you find new places to visit. I think you’re going to love it. Remember, you should be imagining The Station you created when we first visited.

Oh, I do want to answer one question you might’ve had when we last visited because I get this question a lot. If you step through one of the magical windows to leave for your journey, how do you return? The answer is...

Giant Bank Tubes.

That’s right, those clear pneumatic tubes that take the little canister from your car into the bank and then from the bank back to your car. You’ll return from your journey in an enormous one of those. It doesn’t take long at all, and each tube lands gently in the center of the station, after which the traveler just opens the door and steps out. Another common question: when can you come back? You can come back anytime you want.

The shop is just over here in the corner. If you were just passing by, you’d probably think it was a typical airport bookstore. One way you can tell that it’s different is that there’s no checkout register (because there’s nothing for sale here). You might notice that there are people with navy blue aprons helping guests and working at typewriters positioned near each cabinet. These are Wonder Cataloguers and their job is to help you decide where you want to go. Right over there, for example, that little girl is asking the tall gentleman with the silver hair—his name is Philippe—a question. I didn’t hear what she said, but he’s taking her across the room to find something. You might notice now that the shop is not actually filled with bookshelves. Instead, the space is filled with card catalog cabinets—the kind that used to help people find books in libraries. They’re not used much these days (library holdings are mostly organized digitally), which makes it even more exciting to be surrounded by them here (I mean, for me. I love old things).

Each of the little drawers has a brass-bordered label indicating which cards are arranged alphabetically inside: “Technology, An-Bo” or “Experience, Co-Gr.” Philippe is taking the little girl across the room and—oh, he’s so thoughtful—placing a step stool so she can reach one of the upper drawers in the section labeled “Destination, Do-En.” Let’s go eavesdrop. If you all hide here behind this catalog, I’ll tell you what’s happening.

They’ve found the card they were looking for and Philippe is saying “I think you’re going to love it.” He’s explaining that she can look at the white cards labeled “Earthsea” to see all the experiences people have logged when they’ve taken that journey. He’s showing her that there are quite a few cards for Earthsea, actually, because lots of people have gone there (each card can fit about four unique experiences). As he copies down the information from the Earthsea cards for her on a sheet of paper, he’s clarifying that everyone is different and that there’s really no telling how it will be for her. He just handed her the sheet of paper and said (I hear Philippe say this a lot) “no matter what, come back and tell us what it was like for you.” He points over to a big desk in the corner of the room, right next to the self-serve coffee and tea station. A few guests are having a cup of coffee while sitting at the desk, writing on small blue cards. Right next to the desk is a small slot in the wall labelled “Add New Experience.” The Wonder Catalogers take those new submissions and add the experiences to the appropriate cards. You can see Cheryl over there is pulling a blue card from her apron. She’s finding the right drawer and then the correct white card and then pulling it out so she can type more information on it. She’s going to put it right back in the same spot when she’s done.

Sweet gig, right? I mean, again, for me. I love old technologies. I don’t want to disappoint you, but I should clarify that you’re not allowed to use the typewriters. Unless you become a Wonder Cataloger, that is. It’s a coveted position (people wait years for the opportunity). One of the many perks is that you get to use the typewriters. And you get to hang out with Philippe at the WonderCat holiday party.

I’m going to give you some time to peruse the shop on your own. I want you to look around a bit and think about what you want to find. Will you look at the catalog for technologies to see what is listed for the narrative technology you found in our first assignment? Or maybe you’ll see what journeys have made people feel courageous. As soon as you’re done looking around this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you’ve imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Storyworld (assignment #2)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and tecnologies you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. You might look especially for texts that are noted to use narrative technologies that authors use when constructing storyworlds, but this isn’t required. Every story has a storyworld for you to think about.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong>. You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

<h1>Tour Guide Edition (creative assignment)</h1>
This assignment invites you to think of yourself as a tour guide for a future student who chooses to read the text you read for the storyworld assigment. When you’re reading a text written in a time other than our current moment, it can sometimes seem that you’re in a strange land filled with unfamiliar rules and languages. You will position yourself as a tour guide for the student who wants a little help as they navigate this experience. I say you’ll be a tour guide, but you’ll actually be an editor. You will compose an introductory note to help these future students prepare for their journey into the unfamiliar and include notes at moments in the text where you think you would have benefited from an explanation or context. You might consider describing, in your introductory note, what a person in the storyworld of your chosen text can do that can’t be done in our world (or what can’t be done in that world that can be done in our world).

I will show you how to <strong>use Hypothesis to create a tour guide edition</strong>. I’ll help you create a free account, find an existing digital edition of your chosen text, and create annotations in a private group. If you’ve only ever used Hypothesis inside Canvas, you will need to create a free account for the public tool following the instructions here (I will provide guidance in class as you do this): <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/start/">https://web.hypothes.is/start/</a>. I will ask you to draft and revise your annotations in a private group named for your edition. This will allow you to decide how you will share your introduction and notes. We’ll walk through this in class, but here is guidance on creating a private group: <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-create-a-private-group/">https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-create-a-private-group/</a>. If you would prefer not to create a Hypothesis account, let me know. There are ways to complete this assignment without creating an account.

To sum up, here's a list of the things you need to do for this assignment:
<ul>
 	<li>A private group in Hypothesis named for your edition (usually students use the title of the text they’ve chosen)</li>
 	<li>Annotations for a future reader, beginning with an introductory note</li>
 	<li>Citations for all information in notes that incorporate source material</li>
 	<li>If you want your classmates to be able to see your edition, add the “invite group members” link to your storyworld post. If you want to share only with me, you can share the link with me by e-mail)</li>
</ul>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Should this edition be created for the same text I chose for my storyworld post?</strong> Yes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my edition with classmates?</strong> You can share your edition with your classmates by adding a link to it in your storyworld post. You can also keep your edition private by e-mailing me the link to your private Hypothesis group.</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a complete project, you will get 100%.</li>

<h1>Use a Technology of Character Creation (creative assignment)</h1>
After you’ve read and processed your reading experience, I want you to create a new character by using <strong>at least one technology of character creation</strong>. Please share your thought process as you plan to create this character (even ideas you consider but discard). In the last assignment, you were introducing future readers to the storyworld in an assignment, but with this assignment you are creating an entirely new character. This can be challenging! You might consider taking a person you know well (yourself or a close friend or family member) and imagining them as a character in a familiar storyworld (based on reality, like the gym where you work out, or fiction, like Westeros). Or you might imagine a conversation between yourself and an actual person who you don’t know very well, either because they lived in an earlier time period (Mary Todd Lincoln) or because you just haven’t actually met them (Justin Bieber). This is the approach I describe in the preface—it can be very fun!).

When you’re ready (and that might be right away, without any planning!), <strong>write a short narrative (or a small section of a larger work) featuring the character you have created</strong>. This might prove challenging if you haven’t done much creative writing. It was hard for me the first time I did it! This part of the assignment is meant to help you experience the challenges and possibilities of character creation and so it’s important that you move beyond planning into actual creation. This task is challenging because not only do you need a storyworld to place this character into, but you also need to make decisions about how you will narrate this character. Will the character be the narrator or will the character be described by the narrator (or will there be no explicit narrator because you’ll create a play)? What combination of speech, thought, and action will be narrated?

You can compose this in Microsoft Word and upload your creation to Canvas or you add it as a new section of your character post if you want to share with your classmates.
<h1>Plot (Assignment #4)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas.

 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with classmates?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #4)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Summarize the Plot, Then Change It (creative assignment)</h1>
This activity invites you to think about the plot of the story you’ve selected by thinking about how that plot has been summarized. Almost every Wikipedia article about a work of literature has a section with the heading of “Plot Summary.” As we’ve discussed, reading a plot summary can never replace the experience of actually reading a text because it is meant only to convey a summary of the plot, not the full complexity of the text. That said, summarizing a plot is very challenging, as is clear from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the guidance Wikipedia editors have created for the task</a>.

Your first task is to create your own summary of the text you’ve read. If you haven’t finished reading, please focus on summarizing the part of the plot that you have experienced. After you’ve done this, you can check if a Wikipedia article exists about the text you’ve read.

<strong><em>If you’re not done and you don’t like spoilers, ask a classmate (or me) to do this for you!</em> </strong>

If there is a plot summary in Wikipedia, think about how you might improve it with elements of your summary. Paste the plot summary into your post with a clear citation. Below the summary as written in Wikipedia, paste the same summary again and make it better drawing on the summary you wrote or new ideas that occur to you (bold all of the changes you make). Describe why you think your changes improve the summary. If you create a plot summary from scratch, indicate in your post that this is what you’ve done.

After you’ve created your new or revised plot summary, copy it and paste it below, un-bolding all of the things you changed in the previous section. Use this revised summary to <strong>imagine how you might change the plot in some way</strong>. You might immediately have ideas for changes that you think would improve the plot, but you can also use this activity to engage in a thought experiment. What would happen if a character knew something sooner? How would things be different if an event didn’t happen? Remember, your task is to think about the decisions an author has made about the plot. After making your changes to the plot, write about your reasons for making those changes and how you think the changed text might impact readers. Would the changes alter or eliminate the emotions you experienced while reading the text?

Please create a new post to share your Wikipedia summary, your improved summary, and your plot revisions on our course website. You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).

&nbsp;
<h1>Final Project</h1>
You’ve written four posts this semester.<a id="finalproject"></a> Throughout this experience, I have encouraged you to capture and share your responses to literary works that you are experiencing for the first time. As we conclude the semester, I want to give you an opportunity to revisit the literature you’ve read (finishing texts you didn’t have time to finish earlier in the semester) and expand on the discoveries you made through the first four assignments.

Since the start of the semester, our course website has been set to private, meaning that only the students enrolled in the course can see the site. You have chosen between publishing your work (making it visible to your classmates) or keeping it private (so only I can see it). At the end of the semester, I will make our entire website public and you can choose to have your posts included in that public site (visible to anyone who finds our website) or set to private (still only visible to me). You also can set a password for any posts you want to share with family and friends (but not the general public).
<h2><strong>Possibilities</strong></h2>
Select one of the following options for the final project!
<h3>Revise Three of your Posts for Publication on our Course Website</h3>
Revise three or more of your posts for inclusion in our course website, which I will make fully public at the end of the semester. If you choose this option, you will finish the literary work(s) you wrote about in your posts and make sure to include direct quotation or clips to illustrate the specific features you discuss. You will also need to pay careful attention to attribution statements for images and other content created by other people. <strong>I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to publish any of these posts to receive full credit on this assignment.</strong>

<strong>Please add the "final project" category to posts that you are revising for this assignment.</strong>

It can be hard to understand how citation and attribution statements can work together in a publication. I created <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w_-nwr-ersn0/citations-and-attribution-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presentation to help with this</a>. Remember that when you incorporate an image alongside the text of your project, you should include a caption below the image that includes an attribution statement. To craft an attribution statement, follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidance at this Creative Commons article</a>. If you use the image in a context where captions are not possible (if it is included as a featured image that doesn’t display a caption), include the attribution statement under an “Attribution Statement” heading at the bottom of your page. Note that you can include copyrighted images if you are offering commentary on that image in your post because of <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fair use limitation on copyright</a>. You still need to include an attribution statement making it clear who holds the copyright (I typically add “all rights reserved” after the name of the copyright holder).

I will want to see at least one completely revised post when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback. More is better!
<h3>Revise a Plot Summary on Wikipedia</h3>
This option involves expanding on the work you started with the plot summary assignment to actually make changes to the plot summary of an article on Wikipedia. If you select this option, you will plan revisions that will make the plot summary more accurately meet the guidelines provided for Wikipedia editors and then complete a few Wiki Education trainings (listed below) to prepare to make the changes to the actual article on Wikipedia. Your work on this project will be public. I will help you create a Wikipedia account. The Wikipedia username you select and the changes you make to the article will be visible to anyone who wants to view them (even if another editor changes your edits, your revision will be in the article’s history).
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/wikipedia-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/wikipedia-essentials</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/sandboxes-talk-watchlists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/sandboxes-talk-watchlists</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/how-to-edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/how-to-edit</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary</a></li>
</ul>
I will want to see a draft of your revisions to the plot summary when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback and walk you through making them public.
<h3>Be a Tour Guide for a Text from the Past</h3>
This option gives you an opportunity to expand the edition you started with the storyworld assignment, preparing something that future students in this course could use. I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to make this project public to get full credit for the assignment.
<ul>
 	<li>You need to have finished reading the text you select</li>
 	<li>You can keep your edition in a private Hypothesis group or make a public version that will be shared through a future edition of this textbook</li>
</ul>
I will want to see a revised draft of your editorial introduction and your notes when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback.
<h3>Create a Text Exhibit</h3>
In a typical "English paper,” a student presents a claim about a text with paragraphs analyzing specific passages from the text and contextual materials to support that claim. This option invites you to present these same components (a claim about a text and specific passages) as an exhibit of three or more items. More specifically, I invite you to curate a “Text Exhibit” for one new text you’ve read this semester (published in the nineteenth century) to display in our department. Beyond making decisions about what to include in your exhibit, this option also involves taking care in crafting object labels for the items you include. You will decide how much to guide viewers to see what you see in the images you have selected (and how much to leave interpretation open). This option could easily become an exhibit of interesting context for the text (leaving the text itself behind) and I don’t want that, so the only restriction is that at least two of the three items you include in your exhibit should feature actual text (a photo of a specific passage from your copy of the text, an image of the text as it first appeared in print, or some other representation of the text itself). I encourage you to install your exhibit in the hallway outside my office, though you are not required to do this (<strong>You can submit a Word document including three images and the object labels for the images as your final project if you wish). </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>I have a collection of thrifted frames you can select from (and there are hundreds more in thrift stores near campus if you want to find your own!)</li>
 	<li>We can print in color up to 11×17 (I will show you how to prepare your image for printing using free tools)</li>
 	<li>Your primary writing for this assignment will be for the object labels to accompany each item in the exhibit. To help you prepare to write in this potentially unfamiliar genre, please review <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VA_Gallery-Text-Writing-Guidelines_online_Web.pdf">the guidance prepared by the Victoria and Albert Museum</a>.</li>
</ul>
I will want to see a draft of your object labels during our individual conference so I can give you feedback.
<h1>Final Exam</h1>
Our final exam will begin with an opportunity to share feedback on the final projects students have decided to share with the class. We will do this for no more than 20 minutes, allowing the rest of the time for the Final Exam, which is an open book exam. You can prepare for this exam by engaging with the work of the course all semester. For the exam, I will share a text published in the nineteenth century that should be unfamiliar to everyone in the class. Your task will be to read it, describe your experience of it, and describe everything you can about it, using the techniques you have learned this semester (actual reading, identification of generic features, Internet research, database research, etc.). If you turn something in, you will receive full credit on this exam. I use this exam primarily to assess how fully I've accomplished my goals for the course. You are doing the thinking and writing, but I’m the one being evaluated (by myself).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I experimented with this method first in a literature survey course, adapting a structure Angus Fletcher was using with MFA students. I've since adapted the method for three different courses. You can peruse the assignments in the Assignments in Context section of this book; I hope this organization illustrates how this method could be adapted to many types of courses, including a course focused on a specific genre or literary movement. The trick to eliminating the reading list is figuring out how to help students find "new-to-you texts" in the period, genre, movement, or author demographic being studied.
<h2>Frame the course as a research project</h2>
It is powerful to introduce students to literature as a technology that humans invented to respond to environmental problems. As they work to classify their experiences, students will learn about narrative technologies that they didn’t realize were at work in their favorite books and films. This empowering approach to literature is made even richer when we show students how their own experiences and hypotheses can contribute to the growing field of story science. Students have an opportunity to expand how scholars understand literature if they work hard to articulate their genuine reactions to real reading.
<h2>Help students set goals for the semester</h2>
I’ve realized that goal setting is an important first step when giving students more autonomy. Students wind up in our courses for all sorts of reasons, and they of course all have their own life and career goals. I like to encourage students to think of a literature course as an opportunity to encounter texts you wouldn’t choose on your own ("new-to-you texts"). When you’re given an opportunity to choose what you will read, you can decide to challenge yourself in a range of ways. This might mean tackling something that is unfamiliar and a little intimidating. It might mean reading everything you can find that uses a particular technology to better understand how it works. Or perhaps it means exploring texts that have prompted experiences associated with specific psychological benefits. I like to have this conversation with students after I describe the unique features of the course during the first class meeting.
<h2>Embrace creative writing</h2>
The assignments inspiring this course asked students to identify a literary blueprint and then try to use it themselves. I have tried to imagine ways for students to do these things in a literature course. I did these creative assignments alongside my students even though it was uncomfortable at first (I’ve never fancied myself a creative writer). After one semester of these experiments, I found myself thinking in terms of story as much if not more than argument. When I tried to write an introduction that would get students excited about selecting their own texts, I found myself imagining a transportation hub—The Station—where travelers can go wherever they want, whenever they want, by whispering the location into a window (see <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/nineteenth-century-literature#welcometothestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Welcome to The Station”</a>). And as we created WonderCat, a discovery tool that grows with each new story experience entered, I imagined a shop inside that station where employees help people search through huge card catalogs of travel experiences to find new places to visit—for free (see <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/nineteenth-century-literature#introducingwondercat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Introducing WonderCat”</a>).
<h2>Share your love of literature (but don’t expect students to appreciate the things you love)</h2>
It can be challenging to share enthusiasm for something you love with students who are uninterested (or looking at their phones…or sleeping). There are lots of approaches to this dilemma. I have colleagues who see it as a challenge and give a compelling performance for their students, arguing for the brilliance of the authors they’ve assigned (even, or perhaps especially, when they suspect students haven’t read). But I’ve always struggled to convey my enthusiasm when I can tell students aren’t into it. This changed dramatically when I started offering my own reading experiences as a model for what I wanted students to do with their chosen texts. I was able to describe the details I noticed without fearing that I would read them regurgitated back to me in an essay later in the semester. More importantly, because I didn’t feel the pressure to convince students to share my appreciation, I found myself sharing more and connecting with my students as a fellow reader. This became a rich antidote to the demoralizing experience of disengaged students.
<h2>Model the work you want students to do</h2>
Before giving each major assignment prompt, I did the assignment myself, drafting a new post about a text I was experiencing for the first time. This was time consuming, but I honestly think it was one of the most impactful choices I made. The first time I did this, I created a post about literature I had already read and wanted to tell students about. But, when I realized that I wanted to show students how I work through confusion while reading and uncertainty as I process my experiences, I shifted to chronicling my experience reading something new. I was introducing them to literature they might never read, and they were nevertheless curious about what it was in the text that prompted my experience (they even helped me get more specific with some very thoughtful questions-check out <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/algorithms-and-arts/2024/09/17/confusion-paranoia-and-empathy-in-the-terror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the insightful comments on my post about <em>The Terror</em></a>).
<h2>Ask students to start with something they already know</h2>
The strategy of teaching literature with student-selected texts is unfamiliar and can be a bit overwhelming for students at first. It helps tremendously if students get started by thinking about a story they're already familiar with. Each of the courses outlined below begin with a “getting started” assignment that asks students to identify stories that they’ve returned to repeatedly in their lives. In addition to allowing them to get started right away (that is, before they've read something new), this assignment helps each student identify specific experiences and narrative technologies that might inform their reading choices for the rest of the semester. Even if you want students to focus on written texts for the semester, it’s helpful to leave options open for the first assignment (let students choose a text, film, game, song, etc.).
<h2>Structure discussion around features that will be present no matter what is chosen</h2>
As I imagined teaching with this method, I anticipated (and mourned) the loss of class discussion. Though my class discussions weren’t going the way I hoped they would (very few students were coming to class with observations to kickstart discussion), I still wanted students to learn from each other. I was delighted to discover that it is absolutely possible to have a discussion about literature when students have read different texts. I have structured assignments around elements of narrative (storyworld, plot, character) specific genres (text, moving images, sound, etc.), and specific representations (predators, invasives, natural phenomena). I find the learning much richer with this shift of focus. We get a much better collective understanding of these elements, students take ownership of the creative works they bring into discussion, and everyone discovers new creative works they want to experience in the future.
<h2>Curate possibilities (students don't know what they don't know)</h2>
After my first semester teaching with this method, I realized that eliminating assigned reading left some students a bit stuck when it was time to decide what they would read. I dreamed of a tool that would allow students to see what other students had read, what experiences those stories had prompted, and the narrative technologies students identified in those stories. More specifically, I imagined a network graph that would illustrate the connections between specific students, the texts they'd chosen to read, and the experiences and technologies they reported for those texts. I found collaborators and we worked together to create a discovery tool called WonderCat. This tool is described and incorporated into the resources of this book, but it is certainly not the only way to help students discover new texts to experience. If you've ever had trouble deciding what to include on a reading list, imagine the power of including everything you might possibly include in the class on a list that you share with students at the start of the semester. Even better, submit your own experiences with these texts to WonderCat [<strong><span style="background-color: #ffff99">link coming in Summer 2025</span></strong>] so everyone using the tool can learn about them.
<h2>Give students an opportunity to share their writing with each other</h2>
The assignments included below ask students to compose posts for a website that can be kept private during the semester. Students were able to choose whether they wanted to share discussion reflections and formal assignments with me or the entire class. As seen in <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/nineteenth-century-literature#finalproject" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the final project options</a>, the course website also allows students to prepare their writing to be fully public at the end of the semester. This option for students to share their writing with classmates is an important feature of the course. The website also makes it possible for the instructor to read what students are thinking at the end of class discussions. Discussion reflections (described in the “Preparation and Participation” assignment below) reveal where students are getting stuck by asking them to share thoughts they might not volunteer during discussion. OpenLab is the open-source platform we use to build WordPress sites for courses at our university. If you'd like to learn more about using this tool, check out <a href="https://commonsinabox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the description of OpenLab from the developers</a> (you can also see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x-ms9qK5xrc?si=lhm9kP64hN6OnHdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview I did about getting OpenLab established at our university</a>).
<h2>Provide feedback on student inquiry rather than the genre being produced</h2>
The primary method for assessing student learning in many literature courses is an argument-driven paper offering original literary analysis. This is, I think, why <a href="https://analytics.opensyllabus.org/singleton/fields?id=28">the most assigned author in the English literature syllabi collected by the Open Syllabus Project</a> is Cathy Birkenstein, the author of <em>They Say/I Say</em> (Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> is the second most assigned text). I don’t think we need students to produce well-formed interpretive arguments to be engaged in the work of the literature classroom, and I think our emphasis on these papers is one of the reasons students try to find replacements for the work of actually reading assigned texts. The assignment prompts below very clearly communicate that I am not looking for a “typical English paper.” What I didn’t anticipate is that I would need to refine my method of providing feedback to reinforce where I want students to put their energy. Each of the courses below includes a “Classifying Experiences and Technologies” assignment—something I ask students to do after they get my feedback on their work. Here’s what I say in that assignment:
<blockquote><em>After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.</em></blockquote>
Here are some of the tips I find myself sharing with students as I provide feedback:
<ul>
 	<li>We’re not writing reviews, though people reading what we’re writing might decide to check something out that they might not have encountered otherwise.</li>
 	<li>Include lots of direct quotation. If you’re saying that a text has a specific feature, make sure to give an example of that feature.</li>
 	<li>Write to a general audience—clarity is a priority!!</li>
 	<li>Share <em>your</em> experience of the text! Give details.</li>
 	<li>Share your best sense of how the writer prompted an emotional response you had. If you want to research how others have explained the writer’s technique, go for it. Do make sure to cite what you read.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your expertise goes in a different place</h2>
I can’t know what students will choose, which means I can’t possibly be an expert on every work of literature they’ll bring into the classroom. And this is a good thing. Instead of using a lecture or the Socratic method as students first encounter a text, my expertise is useful after students have read and crafted their posts. After they have put their ideas together, it is my role to offer contexts that might help them extend their investigation. For some students, that might mean sharing their enthusiasm and pointing them to additional resources. For others, I can offer context that might turn confusion into curiosity…or frustration into resilience.
<h2>A student can be engaged without finishing the book</h2>
Though I was thoroughly convinced that I did not need an argument-driven essay to know that students were doing the work of the course, it took me a little longer to let go of my expectation that students should work through difficulty and finish the things they’d chosen to read. I was a little disappointed when students reported not finishing the books they’d chosen to read. I think this stems from my early training as a teacher coming from David Bartholomae’s <em>Ways of Reading</em>, which I used when teaching first-year writing. The introduction for students includes a rationale for the challenging texts in the anthology, which included Paolo Freire, Gloria Anzaldúa, and Michel Foucault:
<blockquote><em>When we chose the selections for this textbook, we chose them with the understanding that they were difficult to read. And we chose them knowing that students were not their primary audience (that the selections were not speaking directly to you). We chose them, in other words, knowing that we would be asking you read something you were most likely not prepared to read. But this is what it means to be a student and it was our goal to take our students seriously. Students have to do things they are not ready to do; this is how they learn. Students need to read materials that they are not ready to read</em>. [<span style="background-color: #ffff99">citation</span>]</blockquote>
As a new graduate student entering the classroom for the first time, I internalized this paragraph. I then developed my own version of this advice, guiding students (in academic writing courses and in literature courses) to push through difficulty even when it isn’t fun. But I’m starting to think differently about the goals of a literature course in a moment when university students increasingly view the liberal arts core curriculum as an obstacle to their professional goals. If a student in this situation deliberately selects a challenging literary work and finds it unpleasant, I want to help them process that experience rather than insist that they overcome it.
<h2>Make this your own</h2>
Maybe your metaphor for reading isn't The Station as I’ve envisioned it, but something else. Maybe the units and assignments focus on aspects of literature other than what I’ve imagined so far. I have openly licensed this book so you can make it your own. I'd love to hear what you've done with it and link to your adaptation in a future edition of this book. Practically speaking, adapting this book can be as simple as copying the assignments into a Word document and altering them before distributing to your students. You might also want to <a href="https://guide.pressbooks.com/chapter/clone-a-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a clone</a> of this entire book using the Pressbooks software, making adjustments in your copy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some people travel for healing and some for adventure. Some want to experience a different culture and some just want to kick back and relax. The same is true for reading.

You might have come into this class expecting that I would have a reading list for us to follow, but there’s no assigned reading in this course. If you like the experience of reading the same thing as others (I certainly do), you could decide to read the same thing as a group of classmates. But this course is designed so each of you can decide what you’ll read for each assignment.

My students have told me that it can be challenging to make these decisions. To help with this, I’ve collaborated with some colleagues to build WonderCat, a constantly growing database of story experiences.

WonderCat can help you discover texts according to the narrative technologies, experiences, and benefits others have reported having with them. Certain technologies, like the empathy booster, calm my anxiety and others, like satire, help me laugh at myself. You are not me, of course, and our goal in designing the tool is to help you find stories that work best for you.

If you’ve read a story in WonderCat, check out who read it and what else they’ve read. WonderCat is a database, not a recommender system, but you’ll probably be familiar with this approach powering the recommendations you get in streaming services and online shopping sites (“customers also bought...”). Of course, on those sites, the recommendations are computed with proprietary algorithms drawing on your behavior and demographic data. Those algorithms are built around assumptions about your identity and can’t know your actual experiences (if you want to think more about how algorithms use your behavior and demographics to make predictions about you, <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check if you have a Google adsense profile</a>). I think it’s better to have some agency in these choices and so I’m quite proud that WonderCat is a database that you can search, not a recommender system making predictions about what you will like.

<h1>Welcome to the Station (in-class activity)</h1>
<em>This piece, which I read aloud on the first day of class, is an effort to help students grasp the power of narrative by imagining a transportation hub in which you can go anywhere you want by simply speaking the name of your chosen destination into a magical window. It encourages students to imagine their own version of this station and then introduces the paradox of choice in the Internet age, which has given rise to recommender systems that remove the dilemma of making a choice (and steal autonomy in the process). Many students appreciate this opportunity to listen and imagine, but some have shared that closing their eyes makes it harder to envision what I'm describing. I bring hard copies so students can read along if they want.</em>

In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Closing your eyes can make it easier to imagine the space, but you can also read along if you think that will work better.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a transportation hub filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Villette.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Villette.

Now the glass is glass again. See? (tap tap tap). You can tap it too if you want.

Oh, and if you look quickly across the station in that back corner you can see a whole family leaping together through a window! You can absolutely go on a journey with other people.

It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make-believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that you find wonderful. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. I used a window, but what will you use as a portal? Remember, through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. Trust me, I get it. And I’ll just mention (because I think it will put your mind somewhat at ease) you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Preparation and Participation</h1>
I think class discussion is one of the most important elements of this course and it works best if we all come prepared. You should prepare for each class by selecting something specific you want to bring into the discussion (this might be something you've read or something you've written, depending on the moment in the semester). Before the start of class, I’ll ask each of you to add things you want to discuss to Our Doc (a shared Word Online document). As we begin discussion, I’ll ask you to put devices away and get out your notebooks. I will do my best on the class computer to pull up texts, passages, and random things that come up as the discussion happens. I’ll also give you time at the end of class to compose a discussion reflection on our course website. You should use this as an opportunity to share what you took away from the discussion, whether you voiced your ideas during class or not. Your goal is to write quickly and informally to capture emerging ideas. By the end of the allotted time (or a bit after class if you need more time), I will ask you to publish your post or keep it private (I’ll be able to see it either way). In the gradebook, I will give you a completion grade for your preparation work (added to Our Doc) and for your participation work (entered as a discussion reflection).
<h1>Getting Started (Assignment #1)</h1>
For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select a story that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. Making such a selection can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust me, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Beowulf</em> and from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Bridgerton</em>) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers, etc.) who draw on an ever-expanding set of narrative technologies as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore something you have genuinely enjoyed. Once you’ve put a name to the experiences you’ve had with stories in the past, you can find more stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences (and remember, that’s the point of this assignment).

Once you’ve decided on the story you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right setup to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements for this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the narrative technology the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any other assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think one or more stories work. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). It’s unlikely you’ll figure everything out, and that’s okay. If you do find a source that offers an explanation (like an article or a blog post), make sure to cite it!
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe your Experience</strong></h2>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. If possible, include who or what introduced you to the story. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year. Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced when you encountered the story.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Classify Your Experience</strong></h2>
Now that you’ve described your experience, you’re going to consider whether others have had that same experience with a story. This might be a little challenging because it’s not what we typically do with literature in a classroom. You might be expecting to <em>interpret</em> literature in a course like this, perhaps using class discussion to debate the meaning of Frankenstein’s relationship with the monster he created in Mary Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>.

But with this assignment, I’m not asking you to find out if someone has interpreted the story you’ve chosen in the same way you have. Instead, I’m asking you to determine if others have had a similar experience <em>with any work of literature</em>. You can see in the example experiences below that an experience is different than an interpretation (and wildly different works of literature can prompt similar experiences):
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table class="has-fixed-layout">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Confusion</td>
<td>The feeling of being bewildered or unclear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection</td>
<td>Feeling linked or bonded to others in community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Courage</td>
<td>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Curiosity</td>
<td>When we feel we have some idea about an answer, but are unconfident about what that answer is. The active form of wonder. Where the first form of wonder is passive (essentially pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you), curiosity is active.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>The feeling of understanding another person’s actions. You may not condone the actions or identify with the person, but you accept that their actions weren’t wrong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wonder</td>
<td>An uplifting emotional experience of discovery. As Fletcher puts it, wonder is “life through the eyes of a child” (16). It is like pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you (84).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

&nbsp;

You can peruse the full list of experiences we’ve classified so far in the <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/back-matter/experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiences Glossary</a>.

Instead of interpreting, we’re going to use a scientific method similar to what biologists use when they work from observations in the field toward taxonomic classification of species. If they observe an organism that hasn’t already been classified, they get to name a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). But they might find that what they’ve observed is not a new species (it’s actually just a funny-looking zebra). We’ll discuss new experiences as a class, helping you determine if you’ve actually had a new experience or found a funny-looking zebra. If the experience you had isn’t in the list above, you can give it a name and, if you want, <a href="https://forms.newhaven.edu/view.php?id=379445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propose it for inclusion in WonderCat</a> so it can be represented in our list of experiences going forward.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe the Features Prompting your Experience</strong></h2>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features, so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld, for example), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible. Here are examples of direction quotation and paraphrase:

Direct quotation from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

“My rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow…I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.”

Paraphrase from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

The story is presented from a variety of narrative perspectives: the explorer, Dr. Frankenstein, and his monster.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try to Determine the Narrative Technology That Created the Feature</strong></h2>
As you try to figure out which features of the story prompted your experience, try also to imagine the narrative technology the author used to create those features. I say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to remember that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your experience and who is most likely responsible for it? Below, I describe the four basic elements of narrative (you can click to look at narrative technologies in each category)
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#storyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Character</strong></h3>
This is pretty straightforward. These are the characters doing things in the story. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some character technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!

Once you’ve done your best to identify the technology that prompted your experience, you’re done! Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technology linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore in this assignment (I’d suggest no more than three). You can organize your post according to the steps outlined above, as I’ve done in my example post, or you can write a post that includes all that information but presents it in a way that you think will be more compelling to your classmates. You have the option to share your post with your classmates or keep it private so I’m the only one who sees it.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To Sum Up</h2>
Part 1: Draft your post on course website
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>Describe your experiences</li>
 	<li>Classify your experiences</li>
 	<li>Describe the features prompting your experiences</li>
 	<li>Try to determine the narrative technologies used to create the features you describe</li>
</ul>
Part 2: Revise your post, making sure it includes
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>Any sources clearly cited (hyperlinks for online sources and in-text citations for print sources) with a list of works cited at the end.</li>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (usually an image associated with the story you’re writing about)</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image and any other images included in post.
<ul>
 	<li>“caption” field should include an attribution statement (<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TASL guidance here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>“alternative text” field should provide a summary of what is in the image</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with the class?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don’t need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment. You can also keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in if you are so inclined.</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this?</strong> This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%. This sort of project is likely new to you, so things will be confusing! Do your best and I will give you feedback so you understand the expectations going forward.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on Assignment #1)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Experiments on Emotion (in-class activity)</h1>
After you submit your first post, we will spend time in class looking at the experiences and technologies in WonderCat and considering how those experiences might be beneficial for readers. We will review strategies for searching through our library databases to learn how these experiences have already been studied experimentally. We will workshop discoveries in class and you will submit your findings as a new experience in WonderCat (with the option to keep your submission private).
<h1>Introducing WonderCat</h1>
So, now you’ve done assignment one. You’ve described the emotional experiences prompted by a story that has been meaningful in your life. Maybe you’ve identified specific narrative technologies that prompted your experiences. Good work. Now it’s time to go back to The Station. Before we go back, though, let’s think a little about our first visit to The Station. Because that was a story.

I created The Station to function as a metaphor. I wanted you to feel a sense of wonder as I described a magical place that could take you on a journey anywhere without buying a ticket, going through security, or waiting at a departure gate. In this metaphor I created, I took the act of experiencing a story and stretched it into an actual journey. I’m not the first person to do this, and most people respond to The Station by telling me that it reminded them of platform 9 ¾ in <em>Harry Potter</em> or another fantastical story in which characters could teleport to another place with relative ease. In my version, whispering the name of the place you want to go into a window is like saying the name of the story you want to experience, whether that’s opening up a book and reading the first line, pressing play to start a film, or sitting in a theater as the lights dim and the actors emerge onto the stage.

But like all metaphors, mine glosses over some of the realities. It is true that the Internet makes it possible for you to access a digital version of almost any book in the world in a matter of seconds. But not everyone knows that this is possible (you often don’t even have to go to the library to access their books!). And of course, not everyone has access to the Internet. Accessing a book is slightly more challenging than walking up to a window and whispering a destination, but I still marvel at the magic of libraries. They may not have everything, but they can get almost anything if you ask.

In addition to this feeling of wonder, I also wanted you to feel a bit of the inevitable anxiety that emerges when your options are so open. Humans have not always had near-immediate access to so many stories. In the earliest universities, only the professor (then called a master) had access to the texts he was teaching. A significant part of teaching in the medieval period involved making a text available so students could create a copy, complete with notes on the relevant contexts that they could also only learn directly from the master. But you don’t need to be in a university to access literature now, nor do you need a master to tell you the historical context necessary to make sense of unfamiliar texts. You can read anything, watch anything, play anything. The options are endless! And that is delightful. But also overwhelming. This class is meant to help you make the most of your near-infinite access to literature. And so, let’s go back to The Station to think through this metaphorically. Please get out a sheet of paper. Close those eyes or read along. Let’s go back through the radiator.

I want us to visit The Station again to explore a shop designed to help you find new places to visit. I think you’re going to love it. Remember, you should be imagining The Station you created when we first visited.

Oh, I do want to answer one question you might’ve had when we last visited because I get this question a lot. If you step through one of the magical windows to leave for your journey, how do you return? The answer is...

Giant Bank Tubes.

That’s right, those clear pneumatic tubes that take the little canister from your car into the bank and then from the bank back to your car. You’ll return from your journey in an enormous one of those. It doesn’t take long at all, and each tube lands gently in the center of the station, after which the traveler just opens the door and steps out. Another common question: when can you come back? You can come back anytime you want.

The shop is just over here in the corner. If you were just passing by, you’d probably think it was a typical airport bookstore. One way you can tell that it’s different is that there’s no checkout register (because there’s nothing for sale here). You might notice that there are people with navy blue aprons helping guests and working at typewriters positioned near each cabinet. These are Wonder Cataloguers and their job is to help you decide where you want to go. Right over there, for example, that little girl is asking the tall gentleman with the silver hair—his name is Philippe—a question. I didn’t hear what she said, but he’s taking her across the room to find something. You might notice now that the shop is not actually filled with bookshelves. Instead, the space is filled with card catalog cabinets—the kind that used to help people find books in libraries. They’re not used much these days (library holdings are mostly organized digitally), which makes it even more exciting to be surrounded by them here (I mean, for me. I love old things).

Each of the little drawers has a brass-bordered label indicating which cards are arranged alphabetically inside: “Technology, An-Bo” or “Experience, Co-Gr.” Philippe is taking the little girl across the room and—oh, he’s so thoughtful—placing a step stool so she can reach one of the upper drawers in the section labeled “Destination, Do-En.” Let’s go eavesdrop. If you all hide here behind this catalog, I’ll tell you what’s happening.

They’ve found the card they were looking for and Philippe is saying “I think you’re going to love it.” He’s explaining that she can look at the white cards labeled “Earthsea” to see all the experiences people have logged when they’ve taken that journey. He’s showing her that there are quite a few cards for Earthsea, actually, because lots of people have gone there (each card can fit about four unique experiences). As he copies down the information from the Earthsea cards for her on a sheet of paper, he’s clarifying that everyone is different and that there’s really no telling how it will be for her. He just handed her the sheet of paper and said (I hear Philippe say this a lot) “no matter what, come back and tell us what it was like for you.” He points over to a big desk in the corner of the room, right next to the self-serve coffee and tea station. A few guests are having a cup of coffee while sitting at the desk, writing on small blue cards. Right next to the desk is a small slot in the wall labelled “Add New Experience.” The Wonder Catalogers take those new submissions and add the experiences to the appropriate cards. You can see Cheryl over there is pulling a blue card from her apron. She’s finding the right drawer and then the correct white card and then pulling it out so she can type more information on it. She’s going to put it right back in the same spot when she’s done.

Sweet gig, right? I mean, again, for me. I love old technologies. I don’t want to disappoint you, but I should clarify that you’re not allowed to use the typewriters. Unless you become a Wonder Cataloger, that is. It’s a coveted position (people wait years for the opportunity). One of the many perks is that you get to use the typewriters. And you get to hang out with Philippe at the WonderCat holiday party.

I’m going to give you some time to peruse the shop on your own. I want you to look around a bit and think about what you want to find. Will you look at the catalog for technologies to see what is listed for the narrative technology you found in our first assignment? Or maybe you’ll see what journeys have made people feel courageous. As soon as you’re done looking around this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you’ve imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Storyworld (assignment #2)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and technologies you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. You might look especially for texts that are noted to use narrative technologies that authors use when constructing storyworlds, but this isn’t required. Every story has a storyworld for you to think about.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong>. You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

Part 1: Draft your post on course website
<ul>
 	<li>Describe your experiences</li>
 	<li>Classify your experiences</li>
 	<li>Describe the features prompting your experiences</li>
 	<li>Try to determine the narrative technologies used to create the features you describe (if possible, isolating technologies used to construct the storyworld)</li>
</ul>
Part 2: Revise your post, making sure it includes
<ul>
 	<li>Any sources clearly cited (hyperlinks for online sources and in-text citations for print sources) with a list of works cited at the end.</li>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (usually an image associated with the story you’re writing about)</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image and any other images included in post.
<ul>
 	<li>“caption” field should include an attribution statement (<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TASL guidance here</a>)</li>
 	<li>“alternative text” field should provide a summary of what is in the image</li>
 	<li>“description” field should include the URL for the image file you downloaded</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don't need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment (you should only create notes for the part of the text you are able to read). Keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in and consider expanding your edition at the end of the semester (a more substantial tour guide edition is one option for the final project).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with classmates?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #2)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post.

<h1>Final Project</h1>
You’ve written four posts this semester. Throughout this experience, I have encouraged you to capture and share your responses to literary works that you are experiencing for the first time. As we conclude the semester, I want to give you an opportunity to revisit the literature you’ve read (finishing texts you didn’t have time to finish earlier in the semester) and expand on the discoveries you made through the first four assignments.

Since the start of the semester, our course website has been set to private, meaning that only the students enrolled in the course can see the site. You have chosen between publishing your work (making it visible to your classmates) or keeping it private (so only I can see it). At the end of the semester, I will make our entire website public and you can choose to have your posts included in that public site (visible to anyone who finds our website) or set to private (still only visible to me). You also can set a password for any posts you want to share with family and friends (but not the general public).
<h2><strong>Possibilities</strong></h2>
Select one of the following options for the final project!
<h3>Revise Three of your Posts for Publication on our Course Website</h3>
Revise three or more of your posts for inclusion in our course website, which I will make fully public at the end of the semester. If you choose this option, you will finish the literary work(s) you wrote about in your posts and make sure to include direct quotation or clips to illustrate the specific features you discuss. You will also need to pay careful attention to attribution statements for images and other content created by other people. <strong>I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to publish any of these posts to receive full credit on this assignment.</strong>

<strong>Please add the "final project" category to posts that you are revising for this assignment.</strong>

It can be hard to understand how citation and attribution statements can work together in a publication. I created <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w_-nwr-ersn0/citations-and-attribution-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presentation to help with this</a>. Remember that when you incorporate an image alongside the text of your project, you should include a caption below the image that includes an attribution statement. To craft an attribution statement, follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidance at this Creative Commons article</a>. If you use the image in a context where captions are not possible (if it is included as a featured image that doesn’t display a caption), include the attribution statement under an “Attribution Statement” heading at the bottom of your page. Note that you can include copyrighted images if you are offering commentary on that image in your post because of <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fair use limitation on copyright</a>. You still need to include an attribution statement making it clear who holds the copyright (I typically add “all rights reserved” after the name of the copyright holder).

I will want to see at least one completely revised post when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback. More is better!

<strong>Course Description: </strong>How do we decide which creative works to engage with? How did people discover what they loved before the Internet? How often is an algorithm influencing what we choose to watch, read, or listen to? What is the relationship between recommender systems and human reviewers? Are social media influencers critics? These are some of my questions. I’ve designed this course so it is also (even more!) shaped by the questions that emerge for you about this topic. This might take us in a direction I can’t predict (I hope this happens). There is no requirement that you memorize or become an expert in any of the concepts we discuss, though I suspect we will all leave feeling more aware of the network of algorithms that shape our experiences. I do strongly recommend that you bring your own interests, experiences, and questions to the work of the course. You will complete your assignments by engaging with creative works that you have chosen. My taste is probably not your taste, but I am endlessly fascinated by the things my students find beautiful, compelling, and thought-provoking.

<h1>Welcome to the Station (in-class activity)</h1>
<em>This piece, which I read aloud on the first day of class, is an effort to help students grasp the power of narrative by imagining a transportation hub in which you can go anywhere you want by simply speaking the name of your chosen destination into a magical window. It encourages students to imagine their own version of this station and then introduces the paradox of choice in the Internet age, which has given rise to recommender systems that remove the dilemma of making a choice (and steal autonomy in the process). Many students appreciate this opportunity to listen and imagine, but some have shared that closing their eyes makes it harder to envision what I'm describing. I bring hard copies so students can read along if they want.</em>

In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Closing your eyes can make it easier to imagine the space, but you can also read along if you think that will work better.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a transportation hub filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Villette.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Villette.

Now the glass is glass again. See? (tap tap tap). You can tap it too if you want.

Oh, and if you look quickly across the station in that back corner you can see a whole family leaping together through a window! You can absolutely go on a journey with other people.

It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make-believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that you find wonderful. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. I used a window, but what will you use as a portal? Remember, through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. Trust me, I get it. And I’ll just mention (because I think it will put your mind somewhat at ease) you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Preparation and Participation</h1>
I think class discussion is one of the most important elements of this course and it works best if we all come prepared. You should prepare for each class by selecting something specific you want to bring into the discussion (this might be something you've read or something you've written, depending on the moment in the semester). Before the start of class, I’ll ask each of you to add things you want to discuss to Our Doc (a shared Word Online document). As we begin discussion, I’ll ask you to put devices away and get out your notebooks. I will do my best on the class computer to pull up texts, passages, and random things that come up as the discussion happens. I’ll also give you time at the end of class to compose a discussion reflection on our course website. You should use this as an opportunity to share what you took away from the discussion, whether you voiced your ideas during class or not. Your goal is to write quickly and informally to capture emerging ideas. By the end of the allotted time (or a bit after class if you need more time), I will ask you to publish your post or keep it private (I’ll be able to see it either way). In the gradebook, I will give you a completion grade for your preparation work (added to Our Doc) and for your participation work (entered as a discussion reflection).
<h1>Getting Started (Assignment #1)</h1>
For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select a story that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. Making such a selection can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust me, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Beowulf</em> and from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Bridgerton</em>) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers, etc.) who draw on an ever-expanding set of narrative technologies as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore something you have genuinely enjoyed. Once you’ve put a name to the experiences you’ve had with stories in the past, you can find more stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences (and remember, that’s the point of this assignment).

Once you’ve decided on the story you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right setup to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements for this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the narrative technology the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any other assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think one or more stories work. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). It’s unlikely you’ll figure everything out, and that’s okay. If you do find a source that offers an explanation (like an article or a blog post), make sure to cite it!
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe your Experience</strong></h2>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. If possible, include who or what introduced you to the story. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year. Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced when you encountered the story.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Classify Your Experience</strong></h2>
Now that you’ve described your experience, you’re going to consider whether others have had that same experience with a story. This might be a little challenging because it’s not what we typically do with literature in a classroom. You might be expecting to <em>interpret</em> literature in a course like this, perhaps using class discussion to debate the meaning of Frankenstein’s relationship with the monster he created in Mary Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>.

But with this assignment, I’m not asking you to find out if someone has interpreted the story you’ve chosen in the same way you have. Instead, I’m asking you to determine if others have had a similar experience <em>with any work of literature</em>. You can see in the example experiences below that an experience is different than an interpretation (and wildly different works of literature can prompt similar experiences):
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table class="has-fixed-layout">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Confusion</td>
<td>The feeling of being bewildered or unclear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection</td>
<td>Feeling linked or bonded to others in community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Courage</td>
<td>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Curiosity</td>
<td>When we feel we have some idea about an answer, but are unconfident about what that answer is. The active form of wonder. Where the first form of wonder is passive (essentially pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you), curiosity is active.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>The feeling of understanding another person’s actions. You may not condone the actions or identify with the person, but you accept that their actions weren’t wrong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wonder</td>
<td>An uplifting emotional experience of discovery. As Fletcher puts it, wonder is “life through the eyes of a child” (16). It is like pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you (84).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can peruse the full list of experiences we’ve classified so far in the <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/back-matter/experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiences Glossary</a>.

Instead of interpreting, we’re going to use a scientific method similar to what biologists use when they work from observations in the field toward taxonomic classification of species. If they observe an organism that hasn’t already been classified, they get to name a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). But they might find that what they’ve observed is not a new species (it’s actually just a funny-looking zebra). We’ll discuss new experiences as a class, helping you determine if you’ve actually had a new experience or found a funny-looking zebra. If the experience you had isn’t in the list above, you can give it a name and, if you want, <a href="https://forms.newhaven.edu/view.php?id=379445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propose it for inclusion in WonderCat</a> so it can be represented in our list of experiences going forward.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe the Features Prompting your Experience</strong></h2>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features, so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld, for example), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible. Here are examples of direction quotation and paraphrase:

Direct quotation from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

“My rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow…I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.”

Paraphrase from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

The story is presented from a variety of narrative perspectives: the explorer, Dr. Frankenstein, and his monster.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try to Determine the Narrative Technology That Created the Feature</strong></h2>
As you try to figure out which features of the story prompted your experience, try also to imagine the narrative technology the author used to create those features. I say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to remember that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your experience and who is most likely responsible for it? Below, I describe the four basic elements of narrative (you can click to look at narrative technologies in each category)
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#storyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Character</strong></h3>
This is pretty straightforward. These are the characters doing things in the story. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some character technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!

Once you’ve done your best to identify the technology that prompted your experience, you’re done! Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technology linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore in this assignment (I’d suggest no more than three). You can organize your post according to the steps outlined above, as I’ve done in my example post, or you can write a post that includes all that information but presents it in a way that you think will be more compelling to your classmates. You have the option to share your post with your classmates or keep it private so I’m the only one who sees it.

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with the class?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don’t need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment. You can also keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in if you are so inclined.</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this?</strong> This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%. This sort of project is likely new to you, so things will be confusing! Do your best and I will give you feedback so you understand the expectations going forward.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on Assignment #1)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Introducing WonderCat</h1>
So, now you’ve done assignment one. You’ve described the emotional experiences prompted by a story that has been meaningful in your life. Maybe you’ve identified specific narrative technologies that prompted your experiences. Good work. Now it’s time to go back to The Station. Before we go back, though, let’s think a little about our first visit to The Station. Because that was a story.

I created The Station to function as a metaphor. I wanted you to feel a sense of wonder as I described a magical place that could take you on a journey anywhere without buying a ticket, going through security, or waiting at a departure gate. In this metaphor I created, I took the act of experiencing a story and stretched it into an actual journey. I’m not the first person to do this, and most people respond to The Station by telling me that it reminded them of platform 9 ¾ in <em>Harry Potter</em> or another fantastical story in which characters could teleport to another place with relative ease. In my version, whispering the name of the place you want to go into a window is like saying the name of the story you want to experience, whether that’s opening up a book and reading the first line, pressing play to start a film, or sitting in a theater as the lights dim and the actors emerge onto the stage.

But like all metaphors, mine glosses over some of the realities. It is true that the Internet makes it possible for you to access a digital version of almost any book in the world in a matter of seconds. But not everyone knows that this is possible (you often don’t even have to go to the library to access their books!). And of course, not everyone has access to the Internet. Accessing a book is slightly more challenging than walking up to a window and whispering a destination, but I still marvel at the magic of libraries. They may not have everything, but they can get almost anything if you ask.

In addition to this feeling of wonder, I also wanted you to feel a bit of the inevitable anxiety that emerges when your options are so open. Humans have not always had near-immediate access to so many stories. In the earliest universities, only the professor (then called a master) had access to the texts he was teaching. A significant part of teaching in the medieval period involved making a text available so students could create a copy, complete with notes on the relevant contexts that they could also only learn directly from the master. But you don’t need to be in a university to access literature now, nor do you need a master to tell you the historical context necessary to make sense of unfamiliar texts. You can read anything, watch anything, play anything. The options are endless! And that is delightful. But also overwhelming. This class is meant to help you make the most of your near-infinite access to literature. And so, let’s go back to The Station to think through this metaphorically. Please get out a sheet of paper. Close those eyes or read along. Let’s go back through the radiator.

I want us to visit The Station again to explore a shop designed to help you find new places to visit. I think you’re going to love it. Remember, you should be imagining The Station you created when we first visited.

Oh, I do want to answer one question you might’ve had when we last visited because I get this question a lot. If you step through one of the magical windows to leave for your journey, how do you return? The answer is...

Giant Bank Tubes.

That’s right, those clear pneumatic tubes that take the little canister from your car into the bank and then from the bank back to your car. You’ll return from your journey in an enormous one of those. It doesn’t take long at all, and each tube lands gently in the center of the station, after which the traveler just opens the door and steps out. Another common question: when can you come back? You can come back anytime you want.

The shop is just over here in the corner. If you were just passing by, you’d probably think it was a typical airport bookstore. One way you can tell that it’s different is that there’s no checkout register (because there’s nothing for sale here). You might notice that there are people with navy blue aprons helping guests and working at typewriters positioned near each cabinet. These are Wonder Cataloguers and their job is to help you decide where you want to go. Right over there, for example, that little girl is asking the tall gentleman with the silver hair—his name is Philippe—a question. I didn’t hear what she said, but he’s taking her across the room to find something. You might notice now that the shop is not actually filled with bookshelves. Instead, the space is filled with card catalog cabinets—the kind that used to help people find books in libraries. They’re not used much these days (library holdings are mostly organized digitally), which makes it even more exciting to be surrounded by them here (I mean, for me. I love old things).

Each of the little drawers has a brass-bordered label indicating which cards are arranged alphabetically inside: “Technology, An-Bo” or “Experience, Co-Gr.” Philippe is taking the little girl across the room and—oh, he’s so thoughtful—placing a step stool so she can reach one of the upper drawers in the section labeled “Destination, Do-En.” Let’s go eavesdrop. If you all hide here behind this catalog, I’ll tell you what’s happening.

They’ve found the card they were looking for and Philippe is saying “I think you’re going to love it.” He’s explaining that she can look at the white cards labeled “Earthsea” to see all the experiences people have logged when they’ve taken that journey. He’s showing her that there are quite a few cards for Earthsea, actually, because lots of people have gone there (each card can fit about four unique experiences). As he copies down the information from the Earthsea cards for her on a sheet of paper, he’s clarifying that everyone is different and that there’s really no telling how it will be for her. He just handed her the sheet of paper and said (I hear Philippe say this a lot) “no matter what, come back and tell us what it was like for you.” He points over to a big desk in the corner of the room, right next to the self-serve coffee and tea station. A few guests are having a cup of coffee while sitting at the desk, writing on small blue cards. Right next to the desk is a small slot in the wall labelled “Add New Experience.” The Wonder Catalogers take those new submissions and add the experiences to the appropriate cards. You can see Cheryl over there is pulling a blue card from her apron. She’s finding the right drawer and then the correct white card and then pulling it out so she can type more information on it. She’s going to put it right back in the same spot when she’s done.

Sweet gig, right? I mean, again, for me. I love old technologies. I don’t want to disappoint you, but I should clarify that you’re not allowed to use the typewriters. Unless you become a Wonder Cataloger, that is. It’s a coveted position (people wait years for the opportunity). One of the many perks is that you get to use the typewriters. And you get to hang out with Philippe at the WonderCat holiday party.

I’m going to give you some time to peruse the shop on your own. I want you to look around a bit and think about what you want to find. Will you look at the catalog for technologies to see what is listed for the narrative technology you found in our first assignment? Or maybe you’ll see what journeys have made people feel courageous. As soon as you’re done looking around this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you’ve imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Technologies of Discovery (in-class activity)</h1>
After you have drafted and revised your first assignment, we're going to spend some time in class exploring the technologies of discovery that helped you find what you chose to write about. We'll look closely at the features of creative works that connect the data in those discovery tools (everything from adjectives to genres to user interactions) and brainstorm improvements to WonderCat or another discovery tool that you use regularly. You'll work on this a little on your own, and then we'll break into groups to start working on details. You can brainstorm revisions to WonderCat or another discovery tool you use regularly. You can start designing something that doesn't exist yet. We'll continue this thought experiment after each assignment and I'll ask you to reflect on what emerges during the final exam.
<h1>Film (assignment #2)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to watch one film or series you’ve never watched before (if you choose a series, your goal will be to watch at least three episodes–more if you’ve got the time). I’ll ask you to do things as you watch and after you watch to get the most out of this experience. An equally important task with this assignment is to chronicle exactly how you find this new thing to watch (this was a little hard to recall as we thought about story experiences from the past in assignment one, but you should be able to capture lots of details this time around). You might <strong>let the film or show find you</strong> (as a recommendation on your favorite streaming service) or perhaps <strong>you will find the film or show</strong> by looking into things that interest you (genre, technique, artist, etc.) or searching WonderCat. If you decide to seek something out, you can use the experiences and technologies you identified in the first assignment to assist in your search. Even if you selected a text or a game for the first assignment, there will be films and shows that use the same technologies and have prompted the same experiences.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong>. You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

Part 1: Draft your post on course website
<ul>
 	<li>Describe your experiences</li>
 	<li>Classify your experiences</li>
 	<li>Describe the features prompting your experiences</li>
 	<li>Try to determine the narrative technologies used to create the features you describe (if possible, isolating technologies used to construct the storyworld)</li>
</ul>
Part 2: Revise your post, making sure it includes
<ul>
 	<li>Any sources clearly cited (hyperlinks for online sources and in-text citations for print sources) with a list of works cited at the end.</li>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (usually an image associated with the story you’re writing about)</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image and any other images included in post.
<ul>
 	<li>“caption” field should include an attribution statement (<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TASL guidance here</a>)</li>
 	<li>“alternative text” field should provide a summary of what is in the image</li>
 	<li>“description” field should include the URL for the image file you downloaded</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/algorithms-and-arts/category/film/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website I created with students last year</a> to see posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with classmates?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #2)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Technologies of Discovery (in-class activity)</h1>
After you draft and revise your second post, we're going to spend some time in class exploring the technologies of discovery that helped you find what you chose to write about. We'll look closely at the features of creative works that connect the data in those discovery tools (everything from adjectives to genres to user interactions) and brainstorm improvements to WonderCat or another discovery tool that you use regularly.

<h1>Music (Assignment #3)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to experience an album in a musical genre completely outside your usual listening preferences. I want you to find an artist you’ve never heard of before that creates music in a genre you’re unfamiliar with. I also want you to experience an entire album: a collection of audio recordings organized by an artist in a particular way (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/21/1057783216/adele-spotify-shuffle-30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read more about how Adele urged Spotify to make this easier here</a>). As you did with assignment two, I want you to chronicle exactly how you find and listen to this new music. You might <strong>let the music find you</strong> (it’s unlikely that the recommender systems you use regularly will give you something outside your typical listening habits, but there are other ways things can find you, like scanning on <a href="https://everynoise.com/engenremap.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Noise at Once</a>) or perhaps <strong>you will find the film or show</strong> by looking into things that you are curious about (genre, technique, artist, etc.). If you decide to seek something out, you can use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first two assignments to assist in your search. For example, is there music that can make you feel the way a horror film makes you feel? I also want you to explain exactly <strong>how</strong> you listened to the music. Were you able to stream it as a complete album? Did you pay to download the album onto a device? Did someone loan you a CD? Was the full album on YouTube? Did you try to stream the album from the public library (<a href="https://wm.catalog.lionlibraries.org/Union/Search?view=list&amp;showCovers=on&amp;lookfor=kay+flock&amp;basicType=Author&amp;searchSource=local" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I did!!</a>)? Did you buy a physical album!?! From <a href="http://merlesrecordrack.com/index.html#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a record store</a>?!

<h1>Text (Assignment #4)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and tecnologies you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas.

<h1>Final Exam</h1>
Describe a discovery technology that will best support a community of artists that you belong to or value. That might be comic book illustrators, as-yet-undiscovered hip-hop artists, romance novelists, or something else. Think specifically about ways you can help connect fans with the work these artists are producing.

Now describe a discovery technology that will best support a community of consumers/fans that you belong to or value.

Is there any difference between the design of two technologies? If so, why?]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Course Description</strong>: As humans, we create representations of nature in a wide range of media and for many different purposes. Examples in the creative arts include travel writing, landscape painting, field recordings of birds, and wildlife documentaries. Representations of nature for the purposes of scientific understanding include the naming of plant and animal species and illustrations of biological processes. Scientific theories have emerged alongside photographs captured with powerful microscopes and telescopes.

By looking carefully at representations of nature and asking how and why they were created, we will tackle big questions: What are the limits of human perception? Is it only humans who represent the natural world? How has human technology aided us in perceiving and representing other species? These are some of my questions, but I’ve designed this course so it is shaped primarily by the questions that emerge for you about this topic.

There is no requirement that you memorize or become an expert in any of the concepts we discuss, though I suspect we will all leave feeling more aware of the ways humans have represented nature and how those representations shape our experiences of the world. I do strongly recommend that you bring your own interests, experiences, and questions to the work of the course. You will complete your assignments by engaging with representations that you have chosen. My hope is that the work you do in this course enriches future courses in the natural sciences and helps you cultivate your own approach to environmental stewardship.

<h1>Welcome to the Station (in-class activity)</h1>
<em>This piece, which I read aloud on the first day of class, is an effort to help students grasp the power of narrative by imagining a transportation hub in which you can go anywhere you want by simply speaking the name of your chosen destination into a magical window. It encourages students to imagine their own version of this station and then introduces the paradox of choice in the Internet age, which has given rise to recommender systems that remove the dilemma of making a choice (and steal autonomy in the process). Many students appreciate this opportunity to listen and imagine, but some have shared that closing their eyes makes it harder to envision what I'm describing. I bring hard copies so students can read along if they want.</em>

In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Closing your eyes can make it easier to imagine the space, but you can also read along if you think that will work better.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a transportation hub filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Villette.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Villette.

Now the glass is glass again. See? (tap tap tap). You can tap it too if you want.

Oh, and if you look quickly across the station in that back corner you can see a whole family leaping together through a window! You can absolutely go on a journey with other people.

It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make-believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that you find wonderful. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. I used a window, but what will you use as a portal? Remember, through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. Trust me, I get it. And I’ll just mention (because I think it will put your mind somewhat at ease) you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Preparation and Participation</h1>
I think class discussion is one of the most important elements of this course and it works best if we all come prepared. You should prepare for each class by selecting something specific you want to bring into the discussion (this might be something you've read or something you've written, depending on the moment in the semester). Before the start of class, I’ll ask each of you to add things you want to discuss to Our Doc (a shared Word Online document). As we begin discussion, I’ll ask you to put devices away and get out your notebooks. I will do my best on the class computer to pull up texts, passages, and random things that come up as the discussion happens. I’ll also give you time at the end of class to compose a discussion reflection on our course website. You should use this as an opportunity to share what you took away from the discussion, whether you voiced your ideas during class or not. Your goal is to write quickly and informally to capture emerging ideas. By the end of the allotted time (or a bit after class if you need more time), I will ask you to publish your post or keep it private (I’ll be able to see it either way). In the gradebook, I will give you a completion grade for your preparation work (added to Our Doc) and for your participation work (entered as a discussion reflection).
<h1>Getting Started (Assignment #1)</h1>
For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select one representation of nature that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. Making such a selection can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust me, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Beowulf</em> and from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Bridgerton</em>) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers, etc.) who draw on an ever-expanding set of narrative technologies as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore something you have genuinely enjoyed. Once you’ve put a name to the experiences you’ve had with stories in the past, you can find more stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences (and remember, that’s the point of this assignment).

Once you’ve decided on the story you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right setup to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements for this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the narrative technology the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any other assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think one or more stories work. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). It’s unlikely you’ll figure everything out, and that’s okay. If you do find a source that offers an explanation (like an article or a blog post), make sure to cite it!
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe your Experience</strong></h2>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. If possible, include who or what introduced you to the story. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year. Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced when you encountered the story.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Classify Your Experience</strong></h2>
Now that you’ve described your experience, you’re going to consider whether others have had that same experience with a story. This might be a little challenging because it’s not what we typically do with literature in a classroom. You might be expecting to <em>interpret</em> literature in a course like this, perhaps using class discussion to debate the meaning of Frankenstein’s relationship with the monster he created in Mary Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>.

But with this assignment, I’m not asking you to find out if someone has interpreted the story you’ve chosen in the same way you have. Instead, I’m asking you to determine if others have had a similar experience <em>with any work of literature</em>. You can see in the example experiences below that an experience is different than an interpretation (and wildly different works of literature can prompt similar experiences):

You can peruse the full list of experiences we’ve classified so far in the <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/back-matter/experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiences Glossary</a>.

Instead of interpreting, we’re going to use a scientific method similar to what biologists use when they work from observations in the field toward taxonomic classification of species. If they observe an organism that hasn’t already been classified, they get to name a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). But they might find that what they’ve observed is not a new species (it’s actually just a funny-looking zebra). We’ll discuss new experiences as a class, helping you determine if you’ve actually had a new experience or found a funny-looking zebra. If the experience you had isn’t in the list above, you can give it a name and, if you want, <a href="https://forms.newhaven.edu/view.php?id=379445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propose it for inclusion in WonderCat</a> so it can be represented in our list of experiences going forward.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe the Features Prompting your Experience</strong></h2>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features, so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld, for example), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible. Here are examples of direction quotation and paraphrase:

Direct quotation from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

“My rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow…I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.”

Paraphrase from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

The story is presented from a variety of narrative perspectives: the explorer, Dr. Frankenstein, and his monster.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try to Determine the Narrative Technology That Created the Feature</strong></h2>
As you try to figure out which features of the story prompted your experience, try also to imagine the narrative technology the author used to create those features. I say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to remember that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your experience and who is most likely responsible for it? Below, I describe the four basic elements of narrative (you can click to look at narrative technologies in each category)
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#storyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Character</strong></h3>
This is pretty straightforward. These are the characters doing things in the story. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some character technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!

Once you’ve done your best to identify the technology that prompted your experience, you’re done! Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technology linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore in this assignment (I’d suggest no more than three). You can organize your post according to the steps outlined above, as I’ve done in my example post, or you can write a post that includes all that information but presents it in a way that you think will be more compelling to your classmates. You have the option to share your post with your classmates or keep it private so I’m the only one who sees it.

<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on Assignment #1)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Introducing WonderCat</h1>
So, now you’ve done assignment one. You’ve described the emotional experiences prompted by a story that has been meaningful in your life. Maybe you’ve identified specific narrative technologies that prompted your experiences. Good work. Now it’s time to go back to The Station. Before we go back, though, let’s think a little about our first visit to The Station. Because that was a story.

I created The Station to function as a metaphor. I wanted you to feel a sense of wonder as I described a magical place that could take you on a journey anywhere without buying a ticket, going through security, or waiting at a departure gate. In this metaphor I created, I took the act of experiencing a story and stretched it into an actual journey. I’m not the first person to do this, and most people respond to The Station by telling me that it reminded them of platform 9 ¾ in <em>Harry Potter</em> or another fantastical story in which characters could teleport to another place with relative ease. In my version, whispering the name of the place you want to go into a window is like saying the name of the story you want to experience, whether that’s opening up a book and reading the first line, pressing play to start a film, or sitting in a theater as the lights dim and the actors emerge onto the stage.

But like all metaphors, mine glosses over some of the realities. It is true that the Internet makes it possible for you to access a digital version of almost any book in the world in a matter of seconds. But not everyone knows that this is possible (you often don’t even have to go to the library to access their books!). And of course, not everyone has access to the Internet. Accessing a book is slightly more challenging than walking up to a window and whispering a destination, but I still marvel at the magic of libraries. They may not have everything, but they can get almost anything if you ask.

In addition to this feeling of wonder, I also wanted you to feel a bit of the inevitable anxiety that emerges when your options are so open. Humans have not always had near-immediate access to so many stories. In the earliest universities, only the professor (then called a master) had access to the texts he was teaching. A significant part of teaching in the medieval period involved making a text available so students could create a copy, complete with notes on the relevant contexts that they could also only learn directly from the master. But you don’t need to be in a university to access literature now, nor do you need a master to tell you the historical context necessary to make sense of unfamiliar texts. You can read anything, watch anything, play anything. The options are endless! And that is delightful. But also overwhelming. This class is meant to help you make the most of your near-infinite access to literature. And so, let’s go back to The Station to think through this metaphorically. Please get out a sheet of paper. Close those eyes or read along. Let’s go back through the radiator.

I want us to visit The Station again to explore a shop designed to help you find new places to visit. I think you’re going to love it. Remember, you should be imagining The Station you created when we first visited.

Oh, I do want to answer one question you might’ve had when we last visited because I get this question a lot. If you step through one of the magical windows to leave for your journey, how do you return? The answer is...

Giant Bank Tubes.

That’s right, those clear pneumatic tubes that take the little canister from your car into the bank and then from the bank back to your car. You’ll return from your journey in an enormous one of those. It doesn’t take long at all, and each tube lands gently in the center of the station, after which the traveler just opens the door and steps out. Another common question: when can you come back? You can come back anytime you want.

The shop is just over here in the corner. If you were just passing by, you’d probably think it was a typical airport bookstore. One way you can tell that it’s different is that there’s no checkout register (because there’s nothing for sale here). You might notice that there are people with navy blue aprons helping guests and working at typewriters positioned near each cabinet. These are Wonder Cataloguers and their job is to help you decide where you want to go. Right over there, for example, that little girl is asking the tall gentleman with the silver hair—his name is Philippe—a question. I didn’t hear what she said, but he’s taking her across the room to find something. You might notice now that the shop is not actually filled with bookshelves. Instead, the space is filled with card catalog cabinets—the kind that used to help people find books in libraries. They’re not used much these days (library holdings are mostly organized digitally), which makes it even more exciting to be surrounded by them here (I mean, for me. I love old things).

Each of the little drawers has a brass-bordered label indicating which cards are arranged alphabetically inside: “Technology, An-Bo” or “Experience, Co-Gr.” Philippe is taking the little girl across the room and—oh, he’s so thoughtful—placing a step stool so she can reach one of the upper drawers in the section labeled “Destination, Do-En.” Let’s go eavesdrop. If you all hide here behind this catalog, I’ll tell you what’s happening.

They’ve found the card they were looking for and Philippe is saying “I think you’re going to love it.” He’s explaining that she can look at the white cards labeled “Earthsea” to see all the experiences people have logged when they’ve taken that journey. He’s showing her that there are quite a few cards for Earthsea, actually, because lots of people have gone there (each card can fit about four unique experiences). As he copies down the information from the Earthsea cards for her on a sheet of paper, he’s clarifying that everyone is different and that there’s really no telling how it will be for her. He just handed her the sheet of paper and said (I hear Philippe say this a lot) “no matter what, come back and tell us what it was like for you.” He points over to a big desk in the corner of the room, right next to the self-serve coffee and tea station. A few guests are having a cup of coffee while sitting at the desk, writing on small blue cards. Right next to the desk is a small slot in the wall labelled “Add New Experience.” The Wonder Catalogers take those new submissions and add the experiences to the appropriate cards. You can see Cheryl over there is pulling a blue card from her apron. She’s finding the right drawer and then the correct white card and then pulling it out so she can type more information on it. She’s going to put it right back in the same spot when she’s done.

Sweet gig, right? I mean, again, for me. I love old technologies. I don’t want to disappoint you, but I should clarify that you’re not allowed to use the typewriters. Unless you become a Wonder Cataloger, that is. It’s a coveted position (people wait years for the opportunity). One of the many perks is that you get to use the typewriters. And you get to hang out with Philippe at the WonderCat holiday party.

I’m going to give you some time to peruse the shop on your own. I want you to look around a bit and think about what you want to find. Will you look at the catalog for technologies to see what is listed for the narrative technology you found in our first assignment? Or maybe you’ll see what journeys have made people feel courageous. As soon as you’re done looking around this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you’ve imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Improving WonderCat with Wikidata (in-class activity)</h1>
After you submit your first post, we will spend time in class looking at the experiences and technologies in WonderCat and considering how those experiences might be beneficial for readers. We will then check to see if the representation of nature you've written about is in Wikidata and if it is noted to depict the natural element that it does. We will workshop discoveries in class and you will submit your findings as a new experience in WonderCat (with the option to keep your submission private).
<h1>Predators (assignment #2)</h1>
Humans often represent carnivorous species as predators, occasionally to glorify their power and the fear they inspire in us. We are going to explore how trends in the representation of predators impact our relationship with other species.

After exploring how a variety of species have been represented as predators by scientists (consider the use of the word to classify insects in <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/onhistorynatural00swairich/onhistorynatural00swairich/page/114/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On the History and Natural Arrangement of Insects</a></em>) and artists (from the creators of <em>Jurassic Park</em> to <em>Jaws</em>), our third assignment asks you to find a new-to-you representation of a species that has been categorized as a predator (or a representation of the concept of predation) that you would like to experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and technologies you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. I will help you filter WonderCat results for specific representations of predators or predation.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong>. You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

<h1>Natural Phenomena (Assignment #4)</h1>
Why does the wind blow? What creates waves? Why do plants stretch toward the light? What are those lights in the night sky?

Humans represent natural phenomena according to their understanding of the world, and we make sense of the world in a multitude of ways. Greek myths about monsters trapped beneath mountains offer one explanation for volcanic eruptions, geological charts offer a different explanation, and nature documentaries offer still another take on their power.

Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before that depicts a natural phenomenon. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas.

 	<li>Describe your experiences</li>
 	<li>Classify your experiences</li>
 	<li>Describe the features prompting your experiences</li>
 	<li>Try to determine the narrative technologies used to create the features you describe (if possible, isolating technologies used to create the plot)</li>
</ul>
Part 2: Revise your post, making sure it includes
<ul>
 	<li>Any sources clearly cited (hyperlinks for online sources and in-text citations for print sources) with a list of works cited at the end.</li>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (usually an image associated with the story you’re writing about)</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image and any other images included in post.
<ul>
 	<li>“caption” field should include an attribution statement (<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TASL guidance here</a>)</li>
 	<li>“alternative text” field should provide a summary of what is in the image</li>
 	<li>“description” field should include the URL for the image file you downloaded</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don't need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment (you should only create notes for the part of the text you are able to read). Keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in and consider expanding your edition at the end of the semester (a more substantial tour guide edition is one option for the final project).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Not yet!</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with classmates?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #4)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Improving WonderCat with Wikidata (in-class activity)</h1>
After you submit your first post, we will spend time in class looking at the experiences and technologies in WonderCat and considering how those experiences might be beneficial for readers. We will then check to see if the representation of nature you've written about is in Wikidata and if it is noted to depict the element of invasiveness that it does. We will workshop discoveries in class and you will submit your findings as a new experience in WonderCat (with the option to keep your submission private).
<h1>Final Project</h1>
You’ve written four posts this semester. Throughout this experience, I have encouraged you to capture and share your responses to literary works that you are experiencing for the first time. As we conclude the semester, I want to give you an opportunity to revisit the literature you’ve read (finishing texts you didn’t have time to finish earlier in the semester) and expand on the discoveries you made through the first four assignments.

Since the start of the semester, our course website has been set to private, meaning that only the students enrolled in the course can see the site. You have chosen between publishing your work (making it visible to your classmates) or keeping it private (so only I can see it). At the end of the semester, I will make our entire website public and you can choose to have your posts included in that public site (visible to anyone who finds our website) or set to private (still only visible to me). You also can set a password for any posts you want to share with family and friends (but not the general public).
<h2><strong>Possibilities</strong></h2>
Select one of the following options for the final project!
<h3>Revise Three of your Posts for Publication on our Course Website</h3>
Revise three or more of your posts for inclusion in our course website, which I will make fully public at the end of the semester. If you choose this option, you will finish the literary work(s) you wrote about in your posts and make sure to include direct quotation or clips to illustrate the specific features you discuss. You will also need to pay careful attention to attribution statements for images and other content created by other people. <strong>I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to publish any of these posts to receive full credit on this assignment.</strong>

<strong>Please add the "final project" category to posts that you are revising for this assignment.</strong>

It can be hard to understand how citation and attribution statements can work together in a publication. I created <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w_-nwr-ersn0/citations-and-attribution-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presentation to help with this</a>. Remember that when you incorporate an image alongside the text of your project, you should include a caption below the image that includes an attribution statement. To craft an attribution statement, follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidance at this Creative Commons article</a>. If you use the image in a context where captions are not possible (if it is included as a featured image that doesn’t display a caption), include the attribution statement under an “Attribution Statement” heading at the bottom of your page. Note that you can include copyrighted images if you are offering commentary on that image in your post because of <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fair use limitation on copyright</a>. You still need to include an attribution statement making it clear who holds the copyright (I typically add “all rights reserved” after the name of the copyright holder).

I will want to see at least one completely revised post when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback. More is better!
<h3>Propose a New Unit for our Course</h3>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>Propose a new unit for inclusion in this course and create an example post to introduce the concept to your classmates (in the spirit of “What are Predators?” and “How we talk about Invasives”). The final project should include the post to kickstart the unit and the assignment prompt for the unit (both can be in a single post). This does not need to become public. I considered, but did not yet develop, the following topics that you are welcome to play around with if they are of interest:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>The Universe</li>
 	<li>Non-Human Communication</li>
 	<li>Non-Human Perception</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prepare 3-4 representations for display in the third floor hallway of Harugari Hall (and elsewhere, if you want!).</h3>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>This might be the featured images you selected for the first four assignments, or it might be new representations (or some new, some old). Each representation should be accompanied by an object label, which does not need to be formatted as a table, but should include all information we have been putting in object labels and have a clear goal of helping viewers interpret what you have selected. This will be public (but could be displayed in a space other than Harugari, if you want). I will arrange to have the images and object labels printed before the final exam. That is, I will coordinate the exhibit.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There are four basic elements to a story: narration, storyworld, plot, and character. When you're learning how to identify technologies that prompt your experiences with story, it can be helpful to understand the role of each element and peruse example technologies associated with each element.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. The table below includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not here, you can propose it as a new term!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Here are some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not here, you can propose it as a new term!

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling.

<tr>
<td>Grief Releaser</td>
<td>A plot technology that "abandons the usual forward momentum of plots in favor of a drifting, eddying, dilating story that provides us with time to acknowledge our heartache and dwell upon memories of our loved ones lost" (Fletcher 138).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hamartia</td>
<td>A situation in which a character is not guilty of a moral crime, but has instead made "a mistake of perception, like a misheard word or a moment of blurred vision" (Fletcher 67)</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plot Twist</td>
<td>"The plot twist isn't a twist. It's the final link in a chain of untwisted events, where each link connects smoothly with the one before, carrying the story forward without bends or breaks. Yet even though the chain of the story is arrow straight, its final link is so stunning that it feels like a swerve. It overthrows all precedent, delivering us to a destination unexpected" (16).</td>

<td>Poetic Justice</td>
<td>A plot technology of having good things happen to "good" people and bad things happen to "bad" people</td>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>When students have just drafted a post</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students arrive and open their laptops to add to our shared document one feature (quotation or paraphrase) from the creative work they have selected.</li>
 	<li>Devices are put away.</li>
 	<li>Two students (determined in advance) share their full draft with the class in a revision workshop.</li>
 	<li>All students are then invited to bring their examples into class conversation, collaborating with classmates to understand the complexities of the focus for the day (“how is your text narrated?” or “what is allowed and what isn’t allowed in the storyworld you’re encountering?”).</li>
 	<li>Before the end of class, students open their devices and complete a discussion reflection to post on our course website.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>When students have completed a creative assignment</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students arrive with a draft of the creative activity they’ve started in advance. They open their laptops to add to our shared document information about the specific narrative technology they’ve decided to experiment with and their goals.</li>
 	<li>Devices are put away</li>
 	<li>Students bring their ideas into a full-group discussion about the challenges of the creative activity</li>
 	<li>Students work in pairs to test what they’ve drafted.</li>
 	<li>Volunteers have an opportunity to share their draft with the full class in a revision workshop.</li>
 	<li>Before the end of class, students open their devices and complete a discussion reflection to post on our course website</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>When students have gotten feedback on their post</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students enter at least one story-experience-technology-feature grouping to a table in our shared document.</li>
 	<li>Devices are put away.</li>
 	<li>Students bring their experiences into a full-group discussion about the challenges of classifying their experiences with creative works.</li>
 	<li>WonderCat "Enter an Experience" demo, inviting students to do this when they’re ready.</li>
 	<li>Class discussion about the experiences, technologies, genres, authors, periods students want to experience for the next assignment.</li>
 	<li>Guided exploration of WonderCat, WorldCat, and other non-proprietary discovery tools.</li>
 	<li>Before the end of class, students open their devices and complete a discussion reflection to post on our course website.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This course focuses on the literature of the long nineteenth century. So, for the majority of the semester, you’ll be choosing texts that were published between the years 1789 and 1914. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select a story you've already experienced--one that prompted a memorable experience. We know that this can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust us, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from Star Wars to Beowulf and from Hamlet to Bridgerton) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers) who draw on an ever-expanding set of techniques as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore what you genuinely enjoy. We hope to show you that there are many other stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences.

Once you’ve decided on the story (or stories) that you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right console to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements of this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the technique the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think the story works. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). If you find a resource that offers an explanation, make sure to cite it! You may not figure everything out, and that’s okay.
<h1>Describe your Experience</h1>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year (this will be helpful after you’ve turned the assignment in). Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced.
<h1>Classify your Experience</h1>
Now that you've described your experience, think about whether that experience is something others have felt. This might be a little challenging because it's not how we typically talk about literature. People interpret literature in all sorts of different ways--that was something I loved the most about it when I was a college student. But you're not thinking about whether someone reached a similar interpretation as you. You're trying to decide if others have had a similar experience. You can see in the list of experiences below that it's quite separate from your interpretation. What we're doing here is using a scientific method similar to what naturalists use when they work from observation in the field to taxonomic classification. If they encounter something that hasn't already been classified, they give it a name and call it a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). In the list of experiences below, you might find one that captures the experience you had. If your experience isn't there, you get to name it and, if you want, add it into our list of experiences.
<ul>
 	<li>I felt a sense of wonder (15)</li>
 	<li>I got lost in the story and forgot about my own problems (p. 17)</li>
 	<li>I felt less alone in my trauma</li>
 	<li>I felt courageous (like I would do something even if I was afraid) (34-35)</li>
 	<li>I felt like I was part of a larger community</li>
 	<li>I felt love or emotional connection</li>
 	<li>I felt forgiveness</li>
</ul>
<h1>Describe the features prompting your experience</h1>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was about the story that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible.

Example of direction quotation:

Example of paraphrase:
<h1>Theorize about/Try to determine the technique that created the feature</h1>
Now that you have figured out which features of the story prompted your experience, try to imagine the technique the author used to create that feature. We say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to wrap your head around the fact that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your emotional response and who is most likely responsible for it? [Mike should check out the director of photography on that film]

<strong><em>Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technique linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore.</em></strong>

[pull in full list here or link to the list in the glossary?]

The stretch: taking a regular pattern of plot or character or storyworld or narrative style and extending the pattern further.

<strong>Plot</strong>
plot twist
hurt delay (storyteller constructs a way for trauma to strike a character without the character realizing it…audience knows the trauma before it is felt by the character) (18-22)

<strong>Narrator</strong>
metaphor
human God voice (a narrator who did what a sung paean did: give our brain the feeling of joining a holy chorus that sensed danger nearby) (37)
the Almighty Heart (39)
Intimate disclosure + Wonder (54) [any lyric voice that lays baare a private feeling…any he-she-they story that make makes a personal disclosure about its characters]

<strong>Storyworld</strong>

<strong>Character</strong>
heroic character
<h1>Discuss your choices</h1>
Before submitting your final draft, we will take time in class to discuss what you've discovered. In class, I'll ask you to share the following information from your draft post in our shared Word Online document. We'll focus especially on any new experiences and techniques you might have discovered in your process.
<ul>
 	<li>Literary Work you're writing about</li>
 	<li>Experiences you had while reading (up to three)</li>
 	<li>For each experience, which of the following elements of narrative do you think caused the experience?</li>
 	<li>What technique do you think the creator used to prompt that experience?</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your task with this assignment is to serve as a tour guide for a student who chooses to read the text you choose for this unit. When you’re reading a text written before you were born, it can sometimes seem that you’re in a strange land filled with unfamiliar rules and languages. You will position yourself as a tour guide for the student who wants a little help as they navigate this experience. I say you’ll be a tour guide, but you’ll actually be an editor. You will compose an introductory note to help these future students prepare for their journey into the unfamiliar, and include notes at moments in the text where you think you would have benefited from an explanation or context. You might consider sharing, in your introductory note, what a person in the storyworld of your chosen text can do that can’t be done in our world (or what can’t be done in that world that can be done in our world). I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to make this project public to get full credit for the assignment.

Create a post detailing your experience of the text you've chosen and then share the link to your annotations. You'll share 1-3 distinct experiences you had while reading, specific passages illustrating the experiences, and your assessment of the literary techniques that prompted the experience. You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me.
<ul>
 	<li>You don't need to finish this text to create notes for it. You'll have an option to finish the text by the end of the semester and refine your tour guide edition at the end of the semester.</li>
 	<li><strong>You can complete this assignment using Hypothesis (I’ll help you create a free account and annotate an existing version of the text from Internet Archive). If you’ve only ever used Hypothesis inside Canvas, you will need to create a free account for the public tool following the instructions here (I will provide guidance in class as you do this): <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://web.hypothes.is/start/</a></strong></li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're going to start by focusing on plot. I want you to share your experience reading any written text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before. Think of your post as an account of your journey exploring this literary work (or a summary of your findings). There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with your classmates.

With this prompt, I'm sharing the things I want you to include in your post. You can create three distinct sections with headings, or you can organize things differently if you see a better structure.

<strong>Featured Image</strong>

Your featured image can represent the content of your post in a wide range of ways. The image can be a book cover, an image of a page, or fan art inspired by one of the works you’re writing about. You might also want to create something new to use as your featured image. Make sure that you include complete media file details for your featured image (“caption” and “alternative text” fields). Please also include the URL for the image file in the “description” field.

<strong>Reading Experience</strong>

Describe your experience reading (or listening to an audio recording of) any written text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before (we'll go over strategies for searching). This should be something brand new to you, so you can begin by sharing how you selected it and any expectations you brought with you. Focus on capturing your experience reading with as much detail as possible. Include specific passages that prompted an emotional response from you, even if the emotion is confusion  or frustration  because things don’t make sense to you. You may find yourself looking for context as you read so you can understand unfamiliar words and make sense of a storyworld that is not familiar; describe the sources you reference (Wikipedia articles, dictionary definitions, blog posts, scholarly sources, etc.) and if/how they are helpful. Reading a text written before you were born can be challenging!    In class, we will go over strategies for working through difficulty. [your goal is to share 1-3 distinct experiences you had while reading this text, provide quotation or paraphrase illustrating the experiences, and your best guess at the literary techniques that prompted that experience].

<strong>Plot Summary</strong>

Almost every Wikipedia article about a work of literature has a section with the heading of “Plot Summary.” As we’ve discussed, reading a plot summary can never replace the experience of actually reading a text because it is meant only to convey a summary of the plot, not the full complexity of the text. That said, summarizing a plot is very challenging, as is clear from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary">the guidance Wikipedia editors have written on the task</a>.

Check if a Wikipedia article exists about the text you’ve read. If it does, paste the plot summary into your post with a clear citation.

Below it, create your own summary from scratch or paste the same summary and make changes so that it is as clear and objective as possible. Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary">guidance from Wikipedia editors</a> as you do this work.

<strong>Adapting the Plot</strong>

Take your new or revised plot summary and adapt it, changing some aspect of the plot   that you have experienced up to that point. This can be fascinating to read once you’ve finished the work (and there will be an option to do this at the end of the semester). If you’ve only read the first part of a story, you’ll only be changing things that happen in the first part of the story. Approach this as a thought experiment. Your task is not necessarily to improve the text (especially if you haven’t experienced it fully yet), but to think about the decisions an author has made about the plot. After making your changes to the plot, write about your reasons for making those changes and the impact you think this change will make to the overall text and its impact on readers. If you feel inspired to write new sections of the story for your adaptation, please do, but you only really need to describe an altered plot—not actually create it.

<strong>A complete post should have the following components:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (something you’ve created or something you’ve found</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image (“caption” and “alternative text”)</li>
 	<li>Captions conveying attribution statements for all images in the post</li>
 	<li>Actual post with source material clearly cited with hyperlinks (flyby hyperlinks and actual citations)</li>
 	<li>A detailed account of your experience reading a text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before</li>
 	<li>A plot summary from Wikipedia (if available) and your revision to that plot summary (bold your revisions)</li>
 	<li>Your adaptation of the plot and commentary on what the changes would do (bold your adaptations)</li>
 	<li>A list of works cited at the bottom of your post formatted according to MLA guidelines.</li>
 	<li>Attribution statement for featured image below the list of Works Cited.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Reminders</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>You may find it useful to compose in a document outside of OpenLab (Microsoft Word, a Google Doc, or something else).</li>
 	<li>Assume that there will be spoilers—no need to alert readers to them.</li>
 	<li>We’re not writing reviews, though people reading what we’re writing might decide to check something out that they might not have encountered otherwise.</li>
 	<li>Include lots of images and videos (even when writing about a text). Do your best to break up the wall of text.</li>
 	<li>Include lots of direct quotation. If you’re saying that a text has a specific feature, make sure to give an example of that feature</li>
 	<li>Write to a general audience—clarity is a priority!!</li>
 	<li>Share your experience of the text! Give details.</li>
 	<li>Share your best sense of how the writer prompted an emotional response you had. If you want to research how others have explained the writer’s technique, go for it. Do make sure to cite what you read.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You’ve written four posts this semester, each one focusing on one of the core elements of narrative. We looked closely at narrators, storyworlds, characters, and plots. Throughout this experience, I have encouraged you to capture and share your responses to literary works that you are experiencing for the first time. As we conclude the semester, I want to give you an opportunity to revisit the literature you’ve read (perhaps finishing texts you didn’t have time to finish earlier in the semester) and expand on the discoveries you made through the the first four assignments.

Since the start of the semester, our course website has been set to private, meaning that only the students enrolled in the course can see the site. You have chosen between publishing your work (making it visible to your classmates) or keeping it private (so only I can see it). At the end of the semester, I will make our entire website public and you can choose to have your posts included in that public site (visible to anyone who finds our website) or set to private (still only visible to me). You also have the option of setting a password for any posts that you want to be able to share with family and friends only.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Possibilities</h2>
Select one of the following options for the final project!
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Revise three of your posts for publication on our course website</h4>
Revise three or more of your posts for inclusion in our course website, which I will make fully public at the end of the semester. If you choose this option, you will finish the literary work(s) you wrote about in your posts and make sure to include direct quotation or clips to illustrate the specific features you discuss. You will also need to pay careful attention to attribution statements for images and other content created by other people. <strong>I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to publish any of these posts to receive full credit on this assignment.</strong>

<strong>Please leave your original posts as they are, but copy all of the content into new posts to revise them further</strong>

Check out this <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w_-nwr-ersn0/citations-and-attribution-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presentation demonstrating how to think about citations and attribution statements</a>: both very important when making your work public!

When you incorporate an image alongside the text of your project, you should include a caption below the image that includes an attribution statement. To craft an attribution statement, follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidance at this Creative Commons article</a>. If you use the image in a context where captions are not possible (if it is included as a featured image that doesn’t display a caption), include the attribution statement under an “Attribution Statement” heading at the bottom of your page. Note that you can include copyrighted images if you are offering commentary on that image in your post because of <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/">the fair use limitation on copyright</a>. You still need to include an attribution statement making it clear who holds the copyright (I typically add “all rights reserved” after the name of the copyright holder).

I will want to see at least one completely revised post when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback. More is better!
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Revise a plot summary on Wikipedia</h4>
This option involves expanding on the work you started with assignment four to actually make changes to the plot summary of an article on Wikipedia. If you select this option, you will read the entirety of the text you selected for assignment four (or the entirety of some other text published between 1800 and 1940 that you read for the first time this semester), plan revisions that will make the plot summary more accurately meet the guidelines provided for Wikipedia editors, and then complete a few Wiki Education trainings (listed below) to prepare to make the changes to the actual article on Wikipedia. Your work on this project will be public. I will help you create a Wikipedia account (Wikipedia has an IP block on our campus, which I can explain more in person). The Wikipedia username you select and the changes you make to the article will be visible to anyone who wants to view them (even if another editor changes your edits, your revision will be in the article’s history).

</ul>
I will want to see a draft of your revisions to the plot summary when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback.
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Be a Tour Guide for a Text from the Past</h4>
This option expands on our discussion about storyworld, but takes it in a new direction. Your task with this assignment is to serve as a tour guide for a student who chooses to read a text you’ve read this semester. When you’re reading a text written before you were born, it can sometimes seem that you’re in a strange land filled with unfamiliar rules and languages. You will position yourself as a tour guide for the student who wants a little help as they navigate this experience. I say you’ll be a tour guide, but you’ll actually be an editor. You will compose an introductory note to help these future students prepare for their journey into the unfamiliar, and include notes at moments in the text where you think you would have benefited from an explanation or context. You might consider sharing, in your introductory note, what a person in the storyworld of your chosen text can do that can’t be done in our world (or what can’t be done in that world that can be done in our world). I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to make this project public to get full credit for the assignment.
<ul>
 	<li>You need to have finished reading the text you select</li>
 	<li><strong>You can complete this assignment using Hypothesis (I’ll help you create a free account and annotate an existing version of the text–perhaps from Project Gutenberg).

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Create a Text Exhibit</h4>
In a typical literature paper, a student presents a claim about a text with paragraphs analyzing specific passages from the text and contextual materials to support that claim. This option invites you to present these same components (a claim about a text and specific passages) as an exhibit of three or more items. More specifically, I invite you to curate a “Text Exhibit” for one new text you’ve read this semester (published between 1800 and 1940) to display on the third floor of Harugari Hall. Beyond making decisions about what to include in your exhibit, this option also involves taking care in crafting object labels for the items you include. You will decide how much to guide viewers to see what you see in the images you have selected (and how much to leave interpretation open). This option could easily become an exhibit of interesting context for the text (leaving the text itself behind) and I don’t want that, so the only restriction is that at least two of the three items you include in your exhibit should feature actual text (a photo of a specific passage from your copy of the text, an image of the text as it first appeared in print, or some other representation of the text itself).

<strong>You are not required to install your exhibit in Harugari Hall (though I encourage you to do so!). You can submit a Word document including three images and the object labels for the images as your final project if you wish. </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>I have a collection of thrifted frames you can select from (and there are hundreds more in thrift stores near campus if you want to find your own!)</li>
 	<li>We can print in color up to 11×17 [I will show you how to prepare your image for printing using Canva]</li>
 	<li>Your primary writing for this assignment will be for the object labels to accompany each item in the exhibit. To help you prepare to write in this potentially unfamiliar genre, please review <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VA_Gallery-Text-Writing-Guidelines_online_Web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the guidance prepared by the Victoria and Albert Museum</a>.</li>
</ul>
I will want to see a draft of your object labels during our individual conference so I can give feedback.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking ahead to the “Final Exam”</h2>
The final exam activity will involve sharing final projects. I will also set aside at least thirty minutes during the final exam period for each of you to compose a <strong>statement of practice</strong>, which will describe specific things you have learned in this course and how those things will inform your behavior in the future. This might be related to a future career or it might be related to your non-work life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Day by Day

Day 1:
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss assignment prompt (read in advance, ideally annotated with student questions)</li>
 	<li>Discuss example post (also read in advance, with students encouraged to explore citations and bring passages for discussion)</li>
 	<li>Conclude with guidance on hunting for a text. Students share things they’re interested in (places, events, genres, issues, literary techniques) and the class makes recommendations</li>
</ul>
Day 2: Discuss first impressions of chosen text and build strategies for working through difficulty

Day 3: Discuss reading experience section of post (due before class)

Day 4: Discuss draft character (due before class)

&nbsp;

Prompt for Character Assignment

For this third assignment, I want you to share your experience encountering a new character through written text. Think of your post as an account of your journey exploring this literary work (or a summary of your findings). There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with your classmates.

Create a character...focus on autobiography

Put a person you know really well in another storyworld

Unique thing about this character you’ve never seen in another person

One episode in this character’s life that would help someone understand the character

What character from another work of literature would really get along with this character

<strong>Featured Image</strong>

Your featured image can represent the content of your post in a wide range of ways. The image can be a book cover, an image of a page, or fan art inspired by one of the works you’re writing about. If you include a play or film script, perhaps an image from the production or the movie poster. You might also want to create something new to use as your featured image. Make sure that you include complete media file details for your featured image (“caption” and “alternative text” fields). Please also include the URL for the image file in the “description” field.

&nbsp;

<strong>Experiencing Character</strong>

Describe your experience reading (or listening to an audio recording of) of character in any written text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before (we'll go over strategies for searching). This should be something brand new to you, which means that you will very likely by looking for context as you read so you can understand unfamiliar words and makes sense of a storyworld that is not familiar. Focus on describing your experience reading with as much detail as possible. Incorporate specific passages that prompted a response from you, whether that response is related to enjoyment of the text or frustration about being confused by the text. Make sure to keep track of all of the sources you reference as you read (Wikipedia articles, dictionary definitions, article on the Internet, blog posts, scholarly sources, etc.). Reading a text written before you were born can be challenging! We will go over strategies that can help you make sense of the unfamiliar.

<strong>Create a Character</strong>

You can include both your thought process as you try to create this character (ideas you considered but discarded even), but make sure to try to actually write a section of a totally new story that includes the character you have created.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

Welcome to The Station. I’m guessing by the way you’re gazing around that you haven’t been here before?

It’s incredible, right? It’s something about the combination of natural light that’s coming in, and the stone arches, and the marble floor, and the murals on every surface that isn’t a window (200,000 windows, to be precise). Yes, they are shaped like diamonds though I can't tell you the exact reason why.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people hustling here and there, the acoustics (everything slightly dampened so it’s like this hushed loudness...very calming...like Grand Central Station).

But then also it’s none of the things that make those places terrible. No running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screetching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding." There's a massive arrival and departure board, but no one's staring at it anxiously.

Can you believe that there was a time when people had to travel by horse, or travel for months on the ocean to reach their destinations? That departure and arrival board—the idea that there could be a regular schedule so that anyone could buy a ticket to join other travelers to get pretty much anywhere on Earth…what a stunning feat of human engineering! But, our departure and arrival board is more like a museum piece. Kind of like, see over there? In that corner is an Airstream trailer. You can go inside and sit down and have a snack (endless s'mores). And over there is a stagecoach. You can climb up and crack the whip (they don’t keep the horses here anymore…people kept feeding them).

Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, right. The departure and arrival board doesn’t mean anything (they keep it running because it looks cool). We don’t use it because at The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right behind you, it looks like someone is departing right now. Oh yes, that's Toby. He's here all the time.

Come closer so you can see…he's decided where he's going so he's walking up to a free window.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said “Howard’s End.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don't think he's scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that's right. He's gone now. Not just like, outside the window but on a journey to Howard's End.

Now the glass is glass again. You can tap it if you want. Yeah, I honestly don't know how it works. Some people have been studying it...they've published articles on the physics of this particular place and why it's different than other transportation hubs.

Oh, and look over there! A whole family is going together! The dad is whispering to the window and…they’re all just diving in head first! Yeah, you can definitely go on a journey with other people. It happens all the time.

Oh, don’t worry. Toby can come back whenever he wants. Look over here, someone’s just arriving from a journey. See those massive tubes of frosted glass in the center there? They're all bending toward the center of The Station.

Yes, good point! They ARE a little bit like those tubes at the bank! It's kind of like everyone's in their own little cylinder. I guess they never quite found a mechanism quite so elegant as that.

It’s pretty fun to see people flying back from their journeys. The designers really focused on making the experience of returning pleasant. You just feel like you’re floating as you enter the station—all of your limbs are supported in exactly the right way. It feels like a million little puffs of the perfect temperature of air. I think it smells a little bit like popcorn and Parmesan cheese when I come back. Like puppy paws, you know? Maybe that’s just me though, others have said it smells like sunbum sunscreen. Maybe it’s whatever smell you love the most?

Here, let's ask someone.

Excuse me. Um, hi. I see you’ve just returned from a journey. Can I ask you sort of a weird question? What did it feel like as you returned to The Station?

“Like I was being hugged, but not too tight. And…it smelled like the leaves of a tomato plant. Sorry, uh…I have to go submit my experience”

"Oh yes, of course. Don't let me keep you."

Yeah, I'll definitely explain what's happening now. It'll be very new to you, I think. He's going over to that red glowing sphere in the center of the room. It's called RED. To me, it has darkroom vibes. You seem pretty young. Did you know that before digital cameras and smartphones people had to develop their film before they could see their pictures? The photographic materials are very sensitive to light, so in order to see what they were doing, photographers would use red light in the room.

Oh, sorry to have assumed you wouldn't know. You totally get it then. Darkroom vibes. Everyone's illuminated by RED's glow over there. Pretty magical.

Yeah, so he just plopped down in one of the comfy chairs around RED...he's looking at his notebook, scribbling a bit. It seems like he took notes on his journey. Some people just rely on what they remember, but most people (myself included, to be honest) take notes on their journeys. If you want to submit something to RED, you just find a spot to sit and take a little time to process your journey. There are people he can talk to about his experiences...he’s also going to try to figure out what exactly prompted those experiences. There's nothing really extra special about the people he's talking to, no...they're just fellow travelers. Once he’s processed a bit, he’s going to put his hand on RED to submit his experience. That part is super cool. Let's wait a bit and see if we can see someone doing that.

[drums fingers...waits awkwardly]

I mean, you could go talk to him and help him think about his journey. Do you want me to introduce you? You could just say, like... "hey, Brah. What was it like where you went?"

No?

Well, you can just say whatever. Or, you don't have to. You do you.

[...]

Oh, good. whew. Someone's going up to RED. You see how when she puts her hand on the surface of the glass it glows? If we were close enough (but we really shouldn't crowd her) we'd be able to see that it's bringing up different options for her to select. It's like navigating a smart phone...it even has that sort of haptic thing where you feel a satisfying clunk as you drop the experience you've chosen into the right spot. And then it says really nice things to you when you take the time to try to identify what it was about the trip that caused your experience. Yeah, like "what a clever observation" and "wow, you just made someone's day sharing that!"

Just don't put something in the wrong place or it'll electrocute you!

HAHA...just kidding. That won't happen. There is no wrong answer with RED. I mean the tool will sort of organize what you submit to make it as useful as possible to other travelers, but whatever you put in there stays just as you put it. You can go back and look at all of the experiences you've logged over time, which is actually super fun.

No, he doesn’t HAVE to enter his experiences there. No requirement to submit experiences to RED. Most people (myself included) do it because they want others to know how great their journeys were. Everyone is different of course so people can have very different experiences visiting the same place, but sometimes people come to the station and don’t really have any ideas about where they want to go. They just go up to RED, peruse the places other travelers have gone, and decide what they want to try.

Oh, there is one thing that RED doesn't like...I actually accidentally did it when I first started coming here. I'd gone on a journey and completely could not process what happened while I was there. They spoke a different language there, and there were all sorts of jarring sensations. It was pretty uncomfortable and when I came back I was like "I can't put that into RED! I don't want to muddy up the experiences with this hot mess." So I asked around to other people who had been there before. I found this guy who had the most brilliant things to say about the language. I didn't realize it wasn't allowed at that point...I just selected things that sounded like what he told me and found a random detail in my notes to throw in to make it seem real. Even before I finished my submission a fellow traveler came up and said "wow, that doesn't seem like the sort of thing you've said before...tell me more about that experience" and I said "Oh, uh...I didn't know what to say so I asked other people." She said to me in the kindest way...like, I really wasn't afraid..."come with me." She took me over to this quiet spot in the back of The Station. There was music playing---like the minecraft soundtrack or maybe it was that music they put on in spas? And she asked me to sit down on this really comfy couch. She sat across from me and she said "tell me what it was like." And I told her. I told her all of the messy details. She smiled and nodded and--I couldn't believe it--"THAT," she said, "is what you need to put into RED. That is a brilliant observation! She was amazing.

</div>
Okay, I can tell you're ready to go. Lots of people navigate The Station completely on their own and you can totally do that too as soon as you’re ready. I’ve been traveling through The Station for YEARS (some might say millenia). I love explaining how it works, but I'm learning how to be quiet and let people do what they will. I'll be here if you have a question. I love questions!

Okay.

Good luck! And have fun.]]></content:encoded>

But this is not often the situation in literature courses, especially university courses that fulfill degree requirements. In these courses, students have varying levels of familiarity with and interest in literature. When groups like this encounter assigned reading, it is only natural that some students will read carefully, some students will skim, and some students will skip reading altogether (opting instead to read a summary or wait for class discussion to get a sense of what's going on). The resources in this book work with this natural inclination in our students. These assignments and tools support a radically different way of structuring a literature course, removing the barriers that often interfere with the genuine experience of wonder.]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

An astonishingly original way of teaching that uses novels, poems, plays, and comics to do more than impart technical skills—it uses them to cultivate personal purpose, emotional wholeness, self-insight, and other forms of human intelligence that cannot be replicated by computer AI.

A radically empowering curriculum that places each student’s unique background, individual psychology, and creative potential at the center of the classroom, inviting learners to grow their love of reading and their capacity for imaginative scholarship by partnering with teachers to co-create a syllabus that generates new knowledge.

A rigorous method, rooted in neuroscience and biology, and continually refined via large scale data collection and expert analysis, through a democratic network open to millions worldwide.

That is what Mary Isbell has created. And what you, dear reader, are about to discover in this book.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This glossary is an ever-expanding collection of experiences from readers of literature, arranged alphabetically. Beneath each experience is a brief definition (including any other terms we treat as synonyms), a neuroscientific explanation of the experience, and benefits that have emerged from the experience.
<h1>Connection</h1>
&nbsp;
<h1><strong>Courage</strong></h1>
<strong>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it. Also referred to as "bravery."
</strong>

<strong>Neurochemical Experience</strong>: Courage begins in the amygdala, which senses danger and panics, triggering our “sympathetic nervous system, our periaqueductal gray matter, and the other components of our brain’s threat-response network to release a mix of adrenaline and natural opioid painkillers, boosting our heart rate, numbing our hurt, and filling us with energy” (35). This biological response is meant to help us flee dangerous situations, but it “can be converted into bravery through the addition of one more neural ingrediant: oxytocin.” Oxytocin bonds mothers to newborns. The release is made by our pituitary gland, “a more courageous part of our inner brain that sits just below our amygdala in a bone command bunker, the sella turcica. When the pituitary recognizes that there are “other endangered humans in our vicinity, it releases oxytocin.

<strong>Benefit</strong>: Referred to as "tend and befriend" in the scientific literature, the experience of courage prompts human beings to help others in a crisis. “In times of chronic danger, such as famine or plague, tend and befriend encourages us to share our food and our medicines with the other threatened people sensed by our pituitary. And in times of acute danger (like an ambush), it prompts us to band together in a combat pack. Within that pack, we’re more likely to endure than as a fleeing person. We can stave off—even conquer—threats that would devour us alone" (35)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Very few students in my literature courses read the texts I assign.

Early in my career, I would enter the classroom in ignorance of this fact, prepared to draw on students’ reading experiences to facilitate a discussion that would increase curiosity, reveal biases (my students’ and my own), and inspire a richer understanding of the texts I’d so wisely put on our syllabus. My goal was to facilitate an improvised discussion (not a predetermined lecture) with each participant riffing on the others’ commentary.

Over time, I got better at drawing out the truth of my students’ reading experiences. What I learned was that most hadn’t <em>actually</em> read. Instead, they had skimmed summaries and commentary to find something to say during class. While our discussions were filled with discoveries, it was hard to bring the discussion back to the text because it wasn’t emerging from it. Instead of my dream of an improvisation, I was conducting a performance of preparedness, with dutiful students sharing genuine reactions they’d written in a required response paper and others paraphrasing what they’d gathered from a quick survey of the Internet.

I have finally recognized that I cannot facilitate a rich discussion of assigned reading with unwilling participants. At my university and many others, literature courses fulfill general education requirements, which means many students come into these courses motivated by something other than excitement about my reading list. These circumstances are not conducive to my dream of authentic discussion. Improvisation doesn't work so well when the band is required to perform (and not everyone remembers their instrument).

Once it occurred to me that students might not want to read what I was assigning, I found myself encouraging actual reading the way my dental hygienist emphasizes the importance of flossing. “I know it’s extra work, but it’s important!” Try as I might with collaborative annotation and other technologies (little travel-sized containers of floss), I couldn’t make my students read. And the exercise was demoralizing. Experiencing literature should not be like flossing your teeth.

I was working with colleagues across the humanities to find strategies to address this when I found <em>Wonderworks: Literary Invention and the Science of Stories</em>. In it, Angus Fletcher presents narrative technologies (like the plot twist and the soliloquy) as inventions and explains how they do work on our brains. He does this by explaining the neuroscience behind a range of human experiences with narrative. The most fundamental of these experiences is wonder, the uplifting emotional experience of discovery that makes us pause in astonishment as we encounter creative works.

I realized that while wonder is what inspired me to pursue a career as a literature professor, my students were very rarely reporting this experience while reading what I’d assigned. In fact, I was almost always encouraging them to admit when they didn’t like what I’d assigned in the interest of helping them write authentically. Could this emphasis on the emotional experience of literature be a solution? I wrote Angus an e-mail and asked him how he was teaching literature. Step one, he said, was to eliminate assigned reading so students could follow their own interests. He shared the techniques he was using with MFA students and very generously agreed to answer my questions as I adapted that technique for use in literature courses.

I had already seen the power of student-selected texts in first-year writing courses (inspired by Ryan Crawford’s <em>Emotional Value in the Composition Classroom</em>). But everything I’d experienced about teaching literature took for granted that my students should all read the same text. I had no idea how this could possibly work, but I had to admit that what I was doing wasn’t working either. Even the best class discussions left me feeling like students were doing their best to say things one <em>should</em> say in a literature class. So, I experimented with a survey course in spring 2024. It was rocky at first, but my students were willing to explore with me and by the end of the semester we’d found the structure I'm sharing in this book:
<ul>
 	<li>Instead of working together to interpret a shared text, students select their own texts within the parameters of the course and are given the responsibility of bringing their texts into class discussion.</li>
 	<li>Assignments are organized around elements common to all stories (for example, the elements of narrative), allowing students to take the lead in exploring something specific in the story they choose.</li>
 	<li>Instead of typical English papers (interpretive, argument-driven, contextualized with secondary scholarship), students produce careful descriptions of their actual reading experiences, identify the narrative technologies that prompted those experiences, and experiment with those technologies in creative projects.</li>
 	<li>Instead of assigning secondary reading or giving a lecture to front-load context for a specific text, I provide context and suggest further reading when giving feedback on individual projects. Feedback on assignments then becomes less an assessment of student work than a conversation that continues for the rest of the semester.</li>
 	<li>Students have the option of sharing their work with classmates and making their work public on a course website at the end of the semester. My feedback is presented as a nudge to keep students hunting for the narrative technologies that prompted their experiences.</li>
</ul>
Aside from my occasional fear that the curriculum committee would burst in and charge me with crimes against the literature survey, I thoroughly enjoyed teaching the course. Student reflections and course evaluations reinforced my sense that the change had been transformative. Students reported appreciating the freedom to explore and many shared that they were analyzing far more than they ever had with assigned reading. Why? Because they were curious and wanted to figure things out for themselves.

Needless to say, I think of the students in my first iteration of this course as co-creators of this book; I could not have found this method if they hadn’t shared their experiences with me. I know that each time I use this method I will make more changes, and I’ve openly licensed this book because I expect that this technique will be most useful to others if they also feel free to adapt and modify what I’ve gathered here.

I spent that entire semester and the months that followed interrogating this practice and trying to understand how and why it worked. I started by tracing the role of assigned reading in the long history of literature instruction, discovering that a practical consideration—the scarcity of physical texts and information about them—had established a practice that was no longer necessary in the Information Age. I grappled with the parallels between the professorate and the clergy in interpreting texts for the betterment of humanity, concluding that even if I wanted to transform lives by helping students appreciate the brilliance of George Eliot or Charles Dickens or Jane Austen (and I have wanted this), I have rarely inspired more than 30% of a class to <em>experience</em> their work. And without actual reading, any appreciation that emerged was for my analysis (instead of the authors I most wanted students to experience).

Of course, it still seems blasphemous to suggest setting aside a practice that is, to many, the defining feature of a literature class. How could I teach a class in which students might not encounter the authors I most admire? I found myself wanting to ask these authors what they thought about their work being required and I realized that I could use story to think through these questions. Once the idea occurred to me, I couldn’t stop imagining conversations with my favorite authors.

My first attempt involved Charlotte Brontë bursting her way into one of my dreams to scold me for requiring my students to read her novels. Her complaint was that from her position in heaven (a heaven where dead authors can observe how people on earth are experiencing their works) she was pained by the bad attitudes my students were bringing to her work. She came up with an elaborate analogy to help me understand, asking me to consider what it would be like if my mother required my entire family to read my most recent article before coming to Thanksgiving and then facilitating a seminar-style discussion about it after pie.

I then imagined what George Eliot would say about required reading and her angle was entirely different. It was far more about the experience for the student than her legacy (she was no longer alive, she reminded me). I imagined myself in a rare book reading room, consulting manuscript pages of <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> and finding an addition, very faint in the margins of the second book of the novel (the chapter detailing Tom Tulliver’s painful education in classics and geometry). Just next to the teacher’s observation to his young pupil (“You feel no interest in what you’re doing, sir”), she’d written in the margin “How often are we Mr. Stelling, so committed to the value of what we teach that we neglect the importance of curiosity?” As I looked around the room, amazed at my discovery, she appeared. “I’m not sure why I left that bit out—it’s quite good,” she said as she sat down at the table next to me. We chatted for hours.

In short, I saw my students having a blast experimenting with the narrative technologies in the stories they chose to read and I wanted in on the fun. It was so productive that I've incorporated it into <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdazKKVd3-Mf3xb6ncbYr6uS7giAqvpzGZFiBiXZTSR0NnNrg/viewform?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a workshop designed to help faculty prepare to teach literature without a reading list</a>.

Perhaps the percentage of students who read what we assign has dropped over the years. Or perhaps our shift away from lecturing makes it much easier to recognize something that was always happening (I certainly bullshitted my way through a few discussions as a student). I don’t think it matters which it is or if it’s worse now than it used to be because I believe the solution is in our curriculum.

I should also say that I don’t believe a rich discussion of assigned reading is an unattainable ideal that has never existed for anyone. I am a professor today because I participated in these discussions as an undergraduate; I know how transformative they can be because I experienced many more as a graduate student. My goal in developing these resources for required courses (that is, courses that fulfill general education requirements) is to inspire students to seek out opportunities for these discussions in more advanced courses where assigned reading would be a welcome roadmap for learning.

The most important thing, I think, is that we encourage students to search for wonder in whatever period or genre we are teaching. The second most important thing is that we give them the tools to make sense of their experiences reading. I want to inspire students to read more—much more than I could ever force, cajole, or encourage them to read in a single semester. I want them to reclaim their agency as readers. That’s a tall order, but I think this new structure is a step in the right direction.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>…or a Tesla Model X). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Each of your imaginations is going to supply a much better experience if your eyes are closed.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a space filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Uzumaki.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Uzumaki.

Now the glass is glass again. See? You can tap on it. You can tap it too if you want.It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all of the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that creates awe for you. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. The only change you need to make to the space you imagine is that there is some sort of surface that can become a portal to a destination. Because through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. If you’re feeling nervous about making a choice, just remember that you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This book is under review and will be revised for its official launch in summer 2025. Please see the guidelines below and consider serving as a reviewer!
<h2>Reviewer Guide</h2>
Thank you for reviewing Searching for Wonder: Teaching Literature with Student-Selected Texts. Please take a moment to read through this project summary to familiarize yourself with the book’s purpose and audience before beginning your review.

As we strive to work openly, we plan to include feedback on this book with readers of the published book, which will be licensed under a<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> CC BY 4.0 International License</a>. If you give permission (in the review form), your name will be mentioned in the published version of the book as a reviewer. If you provide feedback but do not give permission for us to share your name, your reviewer feedback will be delivered to the author anonymously and will inform revisions, but your name will not be included.
<h2>About the Book</h2>
Searching for Wonder was written as a guide for those interested in teaching literature with student-selected texts. The first section of the book, “How Does This Work?” is written for teachers, while the assignments and glossaries are written for students.

A draft of this book has been made available on the UNewHaven Pressbooks network for this peer review process. It will be revised for its official launch in summer 2025. The University of New Haven Press, managed by Lauren Slingluff and Amber Montano at the Marvin K Peterson Library, is coordinating this peer-review process.
<h2>Your Review</h2>
We are seeking reviews from teachers of literature interested in considering how the strategies described in this book might work in their courses. There is no compensation for reviews, but you will be named as a reviewer in the next version of the published book (if you give permission on the review form).

This book was designed for use in undergraduate literature courses, but we are very eager to hear from teachers at the secondary and graduate level as well.

When reviewing, we ask you to consider:
<ul>
 	<li>Pedagogy (based on your experience, what kind of learning do the strategies, assignments, and glossaries in this book make possible in the literature classroom?),</li>
 	<li>Appropriateness for Curriculum (based on your experience, how well can you accomplish the goals of the literature courses you teach with the strategies and assignments included in this book?),</li>
 	<li>Approach to Literature (How does the book’s approach to literature complement or complicate the way you typically teach literature?),</li>
 	<li>Consistency (Is the text internally consistent in terms of terminology and framework?), and</li>
 	<li>Organization/Structure/Flow (are the topics in the text presented in a logical, clear fashion?).</li>
</ul>
Please avoid using abbreviations or short forms of words when providing feedback. Doing so ensures that your feedback remains clear and easy for everyone to understand.
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
For inclusion in the next published version of the book, <strong>reviews are due by June 1, 2025</strong>.

When you are ready to review the book,
<ul>
 	<li>Get the online version of the book from <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/</a></li>

</ul>

This review guide can be found in <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/front-matter/this-book-is-currently-open-for-peer-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the frontmatter of the draft book</a> or in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xiH83WwL3q-Ax8mxbMMvzo-RK3PPJCBXZ0d_uxKYa3Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Google Doc</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Day by Day

Day 1:
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss assignment prompt (read in advance, ideally annotated with student questions)</li>
 	<li>Discuss example post (also read in advance, with students encouraged to explore citations and bring passages for discussion)</li>
 	<li>Conclude with guidance on hunting for a text. Students share things they’re interested in (places, events, genres, issues, literary techniques) and the class makes recommendations</li>
</ul>
Day 2: Discuss first impressions of chosen text and build strategies for working through difficulty

Day 3: Discuss reading experience section of post (due before class)

Day 4: Discuss draft character (due before class)

&nbsp;

Prompt for Character Assignment

For this third assignment, I want you to share your experience encountering a new character through written text. Think of your post as an account of your journey exploring this literary work (or a summary of your findings). There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with your classmates.

Create a character...focus on autobiography

Put a person you know really well in another storyworld

Unique thing about this character you’ve never seen in another person

One episode in this character’s life that would help someone understand the character

What character from another work of literature would really get along with this character

<strong>Featured Image</strong>

Your featured image can represent the content of your post in a wide range of ways. The image can be a book cover, an image of a page, or fan art inspired by one of the works you’re writing about. If you include a play or film script, perhaps an image from the production or the movie poster. You might also want to create something new to use as your featured image. Make sure that you include complete media file details for your featured image (“caption” and “alternative text” fields). Please also include the URL for the image file in the “description” field.

&nbsp;

<strong>Experiencing Character</strong>

Describe your experience reading (or listening to an audio recording of) of character in any written text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before (we'll go over strategies for searching). This should be something brand new to you, which means that you will very likely by looking for context as you read so you can understand unfamiliar words and makes sense of a storyworld that is not familiar. Focus on describing your experience reading with as much detail as possible. Incorporate specific passages that prompted a response from you, whether that response is related to enjoyment of the text or frustration about being confused by the text. Make sure to keep track of all of the sources you reference as you read (Wikipedia articles, dictionary definitions, article on the Internet, blog posts, scholarly sources, etc.). Reading a text written before you were born can be challenging! We will go over strategies that can help you make sense of the unfamiliar.

<strong>Create a Character</strong>

You can include both your thought process as you try to create this character (ideas you considered but discarded even), but make sure to try to actually write a section of a totally new story that includes the character you have created.]]></content:encoded>
