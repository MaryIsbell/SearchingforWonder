		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A book becomes a textbook when it's authored by someone who isn't your teacher. It's a very different dynamic when the teacher is the one giving the guidance. This is why we've openly licensed this resource. We want instructors to have the freedom to customize the introduction. Maybe your metaphor for reading isn't The Station as we've envisioned it, but something else. Maybe the units and assignments focus on aspects of literature other than the narrative elements we've used to structure assignments. We'd love to hear what you've done with this text--please let us know and we'll include a link to your adaptation at the bottom of this page!

This course focuses on the long nineteenth century, but it could be adapted to any historical survey by showing students how to find texts they’ve never read that fall in the period being studied (perhaps even encouraging them to explore texts beyond those most commonly assigned). For a course focusing on a specific genre or literary movement, this same approach can work. The trick to eliminating the reading list is figuring out how to help students find new-to-them texts in the period, genre, or movement being studied. These classifications are interpretive (does it matter most when a text was originally published or when it experienced a resurgence in popularity?); we expect that fuzzy boundaries can be very productive to this method.

Assignments in this course asked students to compose posts for a website that was only visible to members of the class during the semester. Students were able to choose whether they wanted to share discussion reflections and formal assignments with the instructor or the entire class. As seen in the final project options below, the course website also allowed students to prepare their writing to be fully public at the end of the semester. This option for students to share their writing with classmates is an important feature of the course. The website also makes it possible for the instructor to read what students are thinking at the end of class discussions (and emphasize the importance of participation by giving credit for reflections as complete or incomplete). Discussion reflections reveal where students are getting stuck (things they might not volunteer during discussion).

In this course, we encourage students to think of literary techiques/forms/inventions as tools that help humans respond to environmental problems. We think that literary scholarship has only started to identify these tools in the available literature and that students can participate in this process, perhaps alerting us to techniques we haven’t yet encountered. Our primary goal is to help students prepare to explore new works of literature for the rest of their lives.

Literature courses differ based on the techniques of explanation, discussion, and independent work that an instructor uses. This course departs from many longstanding techniques within these three realms to try something new.

1. Instead of facilitating interpretation-based discussion of a shared text, instructors help students learn how to articulate their experiences reading texts they have chosen. This puts students in the position of ownership of their reading. The instructor has an opportunity to volunteer interesting context or interpretive possibilities the student might not be aware of when offering feedback on assignments.
2. Instead of instructors contextualizing assigned reading with historical context or the explanation of formal features, students are given the responsibility of finding these things on their own. Instructor expertise is much more important in this process because they are drawing on their knowledge of literary history on the fly or modeling their own research process when they’re not sure of the answer (which will be a common occurrence!). This change can happen primarily because we now live in an era of knowledge abundance. The context for understanding texts is not only available to the professor to be disseminated to students through a lecture.
3. Instead of producing papers of literary analysis, students chronicle their reading experiences and their process of identifying features and literary techniques that prompted their reactions. We have set aside “English paper” assignments because we see literature instruction as distinct from writing instruction. The teaching of logic and other tools of academic argumentation is valuable and happens in writing courses. To assess student learning in the realm of literature, we are not testing them on how well they can recall specific texts, contexts, ad themes. Instead, we ask them to make sense of a text they’ve never encountered before and assess how efficiently they’re taking advantage of resources to make sense of the unfamiliar.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Course Description:</strong> This course is an opportunity to explore the literature of the nineteenth century, a time of great social change and many wonderful genres. Between the revolutionary wars of the late eighteenth century and the the first world war at the start of the twentieth is a complex period that can feel similar to our own and wildly unfamiliar at the same time. Reading literature produced in this period can take you in many different directions. Much of the genre fiction popular today emerged in this period (science fiction, detective stories, and vampire novels to name a few). Fandoms formed around suspenseful novels published serially in periodicals. Photography and moving pictures were invented at this time, making the theatrical history of the period relevant to any film buff. And, of course, there are the novels. They are big. They are brilliant. You might want to read one (probably not two). The possibilities are limitless. I'll help you find "new-to-you" things to read and we'll work together to make sense of your experiences with the literature of this fascinating period.

</div>
<h1>Welcome to the Station (in-class activity)</h1>
<em>This piece,<a id="welcometothestation"></a> which I read aloud on the first day of class, is an effort to help students grasp the power of narrative by imagining a transportation hub in which you can go anywhere you want by simply speaking the name of your chosen destination into a magical window. It encourages students to imagine their own version of this station and then introduces the paradox of choice in the Internet age, which has given rise to recommender systems that remove the dilemma of making a choice (and steal autonomy in the process). Many students appreciate this opportunity to listen and imagine, but some have shared that closing their eyes makes it harder to envision what I'm describing. I bring hard copies so students can read along if they want.</em>

In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Closing your eyes can make it easier to imagine the space, but you can also read along if you think that will work better.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a transportation hub filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Villette.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Villette.

Now the glass is glass again. See? (tap tap tap). You can tap it too if you want.

Oh, and if you look quickly across the station in that back corner you can see a whole family leaping together through a window! You can absolutely go on a journey with other people.

It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make-believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that you find wonderful. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. I used a window, but what will you use as a portal? Remember, through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. Trust me, I get it. And I’ll just mention (because I think it will put your mind somewhat at ease) you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Preparation and Participation</h1>
I think class discussion is one of the most important elements of this course and it works best if we all come prepared. You should prepare for each class by selecting something specific you want to bring into the discussion (this might be something you've read or something you've written, depending on the moment in the semester). Before the start of class, I’ll ask each of you to add things you want to discuss to Our Doc (a shared Word Online document). As we begin discussion, I’ll ask you to put devices away and get out your notebooks. I will do my best on the class computer to pull up texts, passages, and random things that come up as the discussion happens. I’ll also give you time at the end of class to compose a discussion reflection on our course website. You should use this as an opportunity to share what you took away from the discussion, whether you voiced your ideas during class or not. Your goal is to write quickly and informally to capture emerging ideas. By the end of the allotted time (or a bit after class if you need more time), I will ask you to publish your post or keep it private (I’ll be able to see it either way). In the gradebook, I will give you a completion grade for your preparation work (added to Our Doc) and for your participation work (entered as a discussion reflection).
<h1>Getting Started (Assignment #1)</h1>
For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select a story that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. Making such a selection can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust me, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Beowulf</em> and from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Bridgerton</em>) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers, etc.) who draw on an ever-expanding set of narrative technologies as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore something you have genuinely enjoyed. Once you’ve put a name to the experiences you’ve had with stories in the past, you can find more stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences (and remember, that’s the point of this assignment).

Once you’ve decided on the story you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right setup to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements for this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the narrative technology the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any other assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think one or more stories work. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). It’s unlikely you’ll figure everything out, and that’s okay. If you do find a source that offers an explanation (like an article or a blog post), make sure to cite it!
<a id="repeatedprocess"></a>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe your Experience</strong></h2>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. If possible, include who or what introduced you to the story. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year. Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced when you encountered the story.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Classify Your Experience</strong></h2>
Now that you’ve described your experience, you’re going to consider whether others have had that same experience with a story. This might be a little challenging because it’s not what we typically do with literature in a classroom. You might be expecting to <em>interpret</em> literature in a course like this, perhaps using class discussion to debate the meaning of Frankenstein’s relationship with the monster he created in Mary Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>.

But with this assignment, I’m not asking you to find out if someone has interpreted the story you’ve chosen in the same way you have. Instead, I’m asking you to determine if others have had a similar experience <em>with any work of literature</em>. You can see in the example experiences below that an experience is different than an interpretation (and wildly different works of literature can prompt similar experiences):
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table class="has-fixed-layout">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Confusion</td>
<td>The feeling of being bewildered or unclear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection</td>
<td>Feeling linked or bonded to others in community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Courage</td>
<td>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Curiosity</td>
<td>When we feel we have some idea about an answer, but are unconfident about what that answer is. The active form of wonder. Where the first form of wonder is passive (essentially pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you), curiosity is active.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>The feeling of understanding another person’s actions. You may not condone the actions or identify with the person, but you accept that their actions weren’t wrong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wonder</td>
<td>An uplifting emotional experience of discovery. As Fletcher puts it, wonder is “life through the eyes of a child” (16). It is like pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you (84).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

You can peruse the full list of experiences we’ve classified so far in the <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/back-matter/experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiences Glossary</a>.

Instead of interpreting, we’re going to use a scientific method similar to what biologists use when they work from observations in the field toward taxonomic classification of species. If they observe an organism that hasn’t already been classified, they get to name a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). But they might find that what they’ve observed is not a new species (it’s actually just a funny-looking zebra). We’ll discuss new experiences as a class, helping you determine if you’ve actually had a new experience or found a funny-looking zebra. If the experience you had isn’t in the list above, you can give it a name and, if you want, <a href="https://forms.newhaven.edu/view.php?id=379445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propose it for inclusion in WonderCat</a> so it can be represented in our list of experiences going forward.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe the Features Prompting your Experience</strong></h2>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features, so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld, for example), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible. Here are examples of direction quotation and paraphrase:

Direct quotation from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

“My rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow…I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.”

Paraphrase from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

The story is presented from a variety of narrative perspectives: the explorer, Dr. Frankenstein, and his monster.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try to Determine the Narrative Technology That Created the Feature</strong></h2>
As you try to figure out which features of the story prompted your experience, try also to imagine the narrative technology the author used to create those features. I say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to remember that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your experience and who is most likely responsible for it? Below, I describe the four basic elements of narrative (you can click to look at narrative technologies in each category)
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#storyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Character</strong></h3>
This is pretty straightforward. These are the characters doing things in the story. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some character technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!

Once you’ve done your best to identify the technology that prompted your experience, you’re done! Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technology linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore in this assignment (I’d suggest no more than three). You can organize your post according to the steps outlined above, as I’ve done in my example post, or you can write a post that includes all that information but presents it in a way that you think will be more compelling to your classmates. You have the option to share your post with your classmates or keep it private so I’m the only one who sees it.

<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on Assignment #1)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Introducing WonderCat</h1>
So, now you’ve done assignment one.<a id="introducingwondercat"></a> You’ve described the emotional experiences prompted by a story that has been meaningful in your life. Maybe you’ve identified specific narrative technologies that prompted your experiences. Good work. Now it’s time to go back to The Station. Before we go back, though, let’s think a little about our first visit to The Station. Because that was a story.

I created The Station to function as a metaphor. I wanted you to feel a sense of wonder as I described a magical place that could take you on a journey anywhere without buying a ticket, going through security, or waiting at a departure gate. In this metaphor I created, I took the act of experiencing a story and stretched it into an actual journey. I’m not the first person to do this, and most people respond to The Station by telling me that it reminded them of platform 9 ¾ in <em>Harry Potter</em> or another fantastical story in which characters could teleport to another place with relative ease. In my version, whispering the name of the place you want to go into a window is like saying the name of the story you want to experience, whether that’s opening up a book and reading the first line, pressing play to start a film, or sitting in a theater as the lights dim and the actors emerge onto the stage.

But like all metaphors, mine glosses over some of the realities. It is true that the Internet makes it possible for you to access a digital version of almost any book in the world in a matter of seconds. But not everyone knows that this is possible (you often don’t even have to go to the library to access their books!). And of course, not everyone has access to the Internet. Accessing a book is slightly more challenging than walking up to a window and whispering a destination, but I still marvel at the magic of libraries. They may not have everything, but they can get almost anything if you ask.

In addition to this feeling of wonder, I also wanted you to feel a bit of the inevitable anxiety that emerges when your options are so open. Humans have not always had near-immediate access to so many stories. In the earliest universities, only the professor had access to the texts he was teaching. A significant part of teaching in the medieval period involved making a text available so students could create a copy, complete with notes on the relevant contexts that they could also only learn directly from the professor. But you don’t need to be in a university to access literature now, nor do you need a professor to tell you the historical context necessary to make sense of unfamiliar texts. You can read anything, watch anything, play anything. The options are endless! And that is delightful. But also overwhelming. This class is meant to help you make the most of your near-infinite access to literature. And so, let’s go back to The Station to think through this metaphorically. Please get out a sheet of paper. Close those eyes or read along. Let’s go back through the radiator.

I want us to visit The Station again to explore a shop designed to help you find new places to visit. I think you’re going to love it. Remember, you should be imagining The Station you created when we first visited.

Oh, I do want to answer one question you might’ve had when we last visited because I get this question a lot. If you step through one of the magical windows to leave for your journey, how do you return? The answer is...

Giant Bank Tubes.

That’s right, those clear pneumatic tubes that take the little canister from your car into the bank and then from the bank back to your car. You’ll return from your journey in an enormous one of those. It doesn’t take long at all, and each tube lands gently in the center of the station, after which the traveler just opens the door and steps out. Another common question: when can you come back? You can come back anytime you want.

The shop is just over here in the corner. If you were just passing by, you’d probably think it was a typical airport bookstore. One way you can tell that it’s different is that there’s no checkout register (because there’s nothing for sale here). You might notice that there are people with navy blue aprons helping guests and working at typewriters positioned near each cabinet. These are Wonder Cataloguers and their job is to help you decide where you want to go. Right over there, for example, that little girl is asking the tall gentleman with the silver hair—his name is Philippe—a question. I didn’t hear what she said, but he’s taking her across the room to find something. You might notice now that the shop is not actually filled with bookshelves. Instead, the space is filled with card catalog cabinets—the kind that used to help people find books in libraries. They’re not used much these days (library holdings are mostly organized digitally), which makes it even more exciting to be surrounded by them here (I mean, for me. I love old things).

Each of the little drawers has a brass-bordered label indicating which cards are arranged alphabetically inside: “Technology, An-Bo” or “Experience, Co-Gr.” Philippe is taking the little girl across the room and—oh, he’s so thoughtful—placing a step stool so she can reach one of the upper drawers in the section labeled “Destination, Do-En.” Let’s go eavesdrop. If you all hide here behind this catalog, I’ll tell you what’s happening.

They’ve found the card they were looking for and Philippe is saying “I think you’re going to love it.” He’s explaining that she can look at the white cards labeled “Earthsea” to see all the experiences people have logged when they’ve taken that journey. He’s showing her that there are quite a few cards for Earthsea, actually, because lots of people have gone there (each card can fit about four unique experiences). As he copies down the information from the Earthsea cards for her on a sheet of paper, he’s clarifying that everyone is different and that there’s really no telling how it will be for her. He just handed her the sheet of paper and said (I hear Philippe say this a lot) “no matter what, come back and tell us what it was like for you.” He points over to a big desk in the corner of the room, right next to the self-serve coffee and tea station. A few guests are having a cup of coffee while sitting at the desk, writing on small blue cards. Right next to the desk is a small slot in the wall labelled “Add New Experience.” The Wonder Catalogers take those new submissions and add the experiences to the appropriate cards. You can see Cheryl over there is pulling a blue card from her apron. She’s finding the right drawer and then the correct white card and then pulling it out so she can type more information on it. She’s going to put it right back in the same spot when she’s done.

Sweet gig, right? I mean, again, for me. I love old technologies. I don’t want to disappoint you, but I should clarify that you’re not allowed to use the typewriters. Unless you become a Wonder Cataloger, that is. It’s a coveted position (people wait years for the opportunity). One of the many perks is that you get to use the typewriters. And you get to hang out with Philippe at the WonderCat holiday party.

I’m going to give you some time to peruse the shop on your own. I want you to look around a bit and think about what you want to find. Will you look at the catalog for technologies to see what is listed for the narrative technology you found in our first assignment? Or maybe you’ll see what journeys have made people feel courageous. As soon as you’re done looking around this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you’ve imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Storyworld (assignment #2)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and tecnologies you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. You might look especially for texts that are noted to use narrative technologies that authors use when constructing storyworlds, but this isn’t required. Every story has a storyworld for you to think about.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <a href="#repeatedprocess" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong></a>. You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #2)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like.

If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Tour Guide Edition (creative assignment)</h1>
This assignment invites you to think of yourself as a tour guide for a future student who chooses to read the text you read for the storyworld assigment. When you’re reading a text written in a time other than our current moment, it can sometimes seem that you’re in a strange land filled with unfamiliar rules and languages. You will position yourself as a tour guide for the student who wants a little help as they navigate this experience. I say you’ll be a tour guide, but you’ll actually be an editor. You will compose an introductory note to help these future students prepare for their journey into the unfamiliar and include notes at moments in the text where you think you would have benefited from an explanation or context. You might consider describing, in your introductory note, what a person in the storyworld of your chosen text can do that can’t be done in our world (or what can’t be done in that world that can be done in our world).

I will show you how to <strong>use Hypothesis to create a tour guide edition</strong>. I’ll help you create a free account, find an existing digital edition of your chosen text, and create annotations in a private group. If you’ve only ever used Hypothesis inside Canvas, you will need to create a free account for the public tool following the instructions here (I will provide guidance in class as you do this): <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/start/">https://web.hypothes.is/start/</a>. I will ask you to draft and revise your annotations in a private group named for your edition. This will allow you to decide how you will share your introduction and notes. We’ll walk through this in class, but here is guidance on creating a private group: <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-create-a-private-group/">https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-create-a-private-group/</a>. If you would prefer not to create a Hypothesis account, let me know. There are ways to complete this assignment without creating an account.

To sum up, here's a list of the things you need to do for this assignment:
<ul>
 	<li>A private group in Hypothesis named for your edition (usually students use the title of the text they’ve chosen)</li>
 	<li>Annotations for a future reader, beginning with an introductory note</li>
 	<li>Citations for all information in notes that incorporate source material</li>
 	<li>If you want your classmates to be able to see your edition, add the “invite group members” link to your storyworld post. If you want to share only with me, you can share the link with me by e-mail)</li>

<h1>Character (Assignment #3)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. You might look especially for texts that are noted for technologies of character creation, but this isn’t required. All stories have characters.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <a href="#repeatedprocess" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong></a>. You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

Part 1: Draft your post on course website
<ul>
 	<li>Describe your experiences</li>
 	<li>Classify your experiences</li>
 	<li>Describe the features prompting your experiences</li>
 	<li>Try to determine the narrative technologies used to create the features you describe (if possible, isolating technologies used to create one or more characters)</li>
</ul>
Part 2: Revise your post, making sure it includes
<ul>
 	<li>Any sources clearly cited (hyperlinks for online sources and in-text citations for print sources) with a list of works cited at the end.</li>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (usually an image associated with the story you’re writing about)</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image and any other images included in post.
<ul>
 	<li>“caption” field should include an attribution statement (<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TASL guidance here</a>)</li>
 	<li>“alternative text” field should provide a summary of what is in the image</li>
 	<li>“description” field should include the URL for the image file you downloaded</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don't need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment (you should only create notes for the part of the text you are able to read). Keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in and consider expanding your edition at the end of the semester (a more substantial tour guide edition is one option for the final project).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with classmates?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #3)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Use a Technology of Character Creation (creative assignment)</h1>
After you’ve read and processed your reading experience, I want you to create a new character by using <strong>at least one technology of character creation</strong>. Please share your thought process as you plan to create this character (even ideas you consider but discard). In the last assignment, you were introducing future readers to the storyworld in an assignment, but with this assignment you are creating an entirely new character. This can be challenging! You might consider taking a person you know well (yourself or a close friend or family member) and imagining them as a character in a familiar storyworld (based on reality, like the gym where you work out, or fiction, like Westeros). Or you might imagine a conversation between yourself and an actual person who you don’t know very well, either because they lived in an earlier time period (Mary Todd Lincoln) or because you just haven’t actually met them (Justin Bieber). This is the approach I describe in the preface—it can be very fun!).

When you’re ready (and that might be right away, without any planning!), <strong>write a short narrative (or a small section of a larger work) featuring the character you have created</strong>. This might prove challenging if you haven’t done much creative writing. It was hard for me the first time I did it! This part of the assignment is meant to help you experience the challenges and possibilities of character creation and so it’s important that you move beyond planning into actual creation. This task is challenging because not only do you need a storyworld to place this character into, but you also need to make decisions about how you will narrate this character. Will the character be the narrator or will the character be described by the narrator (or will there be no explicit narrator because you’ll create a play)? What combination of speech, thought, and action will be narrated?

You can compose this in Microsoft Word and upload your creation to Canvas or you add it as a new section of your character post if you want to share with your classmates.
<h1>Plot (Assignment #4)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. You might look especially for texts that are noted to use narrative technologies that authors use when creating plots, but this isn’t required. All stories have a plot.

<h1>Summarize the Plot, Then Change It (creative assignment)</h1>
This activity invites you to think about the plot of the story you’ve selected by thinking about how that plot has been summarized. Almost every Wikipedia article about a work of literature has a section with the heading of “Plot Summary.” As we’ve discussed, reading a plot summary can never replace the experience of actually reading a text because it is meant only to convey a summary of the plot, not the full complexity of the text. That said, summarizing a plot is very challenging, as is clear from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the guidance Wikipedia editors have created for the task</a>.

Your first task is to create your own summary of the text you’ve read. If you haven’t finished reading, please focus on summarizing the part of the plot that you have experienced. After you’ve done this, you can check if a Wikipedia article exists about the text you’ve read.

<strong><em>If you’re not done and you don’t like spoilers, ask a classmate (or me) to do this for you!</em> </strong>

If there is a plot summary in Wikipedia, think about how you might improve it with elements of your summary. Paste the plot summary into your post with a clear citation. Below the summary as written in Wikipedia, paste the same summary again and make it better drawing on the summary you wrote or new ideas that occur to you (bold all of the changes you make). Describe why you think your changes improve the summary. If you create a plot summary from scratch, indicate in your post that this is what you’ve done.

After you’ve created your new or revised plot summary, copy it and paste it below, un-bolding all of the things you changed in the previous section. Use this revised summary to <strong>imagine how you might change the plot in some way</strong>. You might immediately have ideas for changes that you think would improve the plot, but you can also use this activity to engage in a thought experiment. What would happen if a character knew something sooner? How would things be different if an event didn’t happen? Remember, your task is to think about the decisions an author has made about the plot. After making your changes to the plot, write about your reasons for making those changes and how you think the changed text might impact readers. Would the changes alter or eliminate the emotions you experienced while reading the text?

Please create a new post to share your Wikipedia summary, your improved summary, and your plot revisions on our course website. You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).

&nbsp;
<h1>Final Project</h1>
You’ve written four posts this semester. Throughout this experience, I have encouraged you to capture and share your responses to literary works that you are experiencing for the first time. As we conclude the semester, I want to give you an opportunity to revisit the literature you’ve read and expand on the discoveries you made through the first four assignments.

Since the start of the semester, our course website has been set to private, meaning that only the students enrolled in the course can see the site. You have chosen between publishing your work (making it visible to your classmates) or keeping it private (so only I can see it). At the end of the semester, I will make our entire website public and you can choose to have your posts included in that public site (visible to anyone who finds our website) or set to private (still only visible to me). You also can set a password for any posts you want to share with family and friends (but not the general public).
<h2><strong>Possibilities</strong></h2>
Select one of the following options for the final project!
<h3>Revise Three of your Posts for Publication on our Course Website</h3>
Revise three or more of your posts for inclusion in our course website, which I will make fully public at the end of the semester. If you choose this option, you will finish the literary work(s) you wrote about in your posts and make sure to include direct quotation or clips to illustrate the specific features you discuss. You will also need to pay careful attention to attribution statements for images and other content created by other people. <strong>I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to publish any of these posts to receive full credit on this assignment.</strong>

<strong>Please add the "final project" category to posts that you are revising for this assignment.</strong>

It can be hard to understand how citation and attribution statements can work together in a publication. I created <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w_-nwr-ersn0/citations-and-attribution-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presentation to help with this</a>. Remember that when you incorporate an image alongside the text of your project, you should include a caption below the image that includes an attribution statement. To craft an attribution statement, follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidance at this Creative Commons article</a>. If you use the image in a context where captions are not possible (if it is included as a featured image that doesn’t display a caption), include the attribution statement under an “Attribution Statement” heading at the bottom of your page. Note that you can include copyrighted images if you are offering commentary on that image in your post because of <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fair use limitation on copyright</a>. You still need to include an attribution statement making it clear who holds the copyright (I typically add “all rights reserved” after the name of the copyright holder).

I will want to see at least one completely revised post when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback. More is better!
<h3>Revise a Plot Summary on Wikipedia</h3>
This option involves expanding on the work you started with the plot summary assignment to actually make changes to the plot summary of an article on Wikipedia. If you select this option, you will plan revisions that will make the plot summary more accurately meet the guidelines provided for Wikipedia editors and then complete a few Wiki Education trainings (listed below) to prepare to make the changes to the actual article on Wikipedia. Your work on this project will be public. I will help you create a Wikipedia account. The Wikipedia username you select and the changes you make to the article will be visible to anyone who wants to view them (even if another editor changes your edits, your revision will be in the article’s history).
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/wikipedia-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/wikipedia-essentials</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/sandboxes-talk-watchlists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/sandboxes-talk-watchlists</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/how-to-edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/how-to-edit</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary</a></li>
</ul>
I will want to see a draft of your revisions to the plot summary when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback and walk you through making them public.
<h3>Be a Tour Guide for a Text from the Past</h3>
This option gives you an opportunity to expand the edition you started with the storyworld assignment, preparing something that future students in this course could use. I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to make this project public to get full credit for the assignment.
<ul>
 	<li>Only annotate the portion of the text you've read</li>
 	<li>You can keep your edition in a private Hypothesis group or make a public version that will be shared through a future edition of this textbook</li>
</ul>
I will want to see a revised draft of your editorial introduction and your notes when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback.
<h3>Create a Text Exhibit</h3>
In a typical "English paper,” a student presents a claim about a text with paragraphs analyzing specific passages from the text and contextual materials to support that claim. This option invites you to present these same components (a claim about a text and specific passages) as an exhibit of three or more items. More specifically, I invite you to curate a “Text Exhibit” for one new text you’ve read this semester (published in the nineteenth century) to display in our department. Beyond making decisions about what to include in your exhibit, this option also involves taking care in crafting object labels for the items you include. You will decide how much to guide viewers to see what you see in the images you have selected (and how much to leave interpretation open). This option could easily become an exhibit of interesting context for the text (leaving the text itself behind) and I don’t want that, so the only restriction is that at least two of the three items you include in your exhibit should feature actual text (a photo of a specific passage from your copy of the text, an image of the text as it first appeared in print, or some other representation of the text itself). I encourage you to install your exhibit in the hallway outside my office, though you are not required to do this (<strong>You can submit a Word document including three images and the object labels for the images as your final project if you wish). </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>I have a collection of thrifted frames you can select from (and there are hundreds more in thrift stores near campus if you want to find your own!)</li>
 	<li>We can print in color up to 11×17 (I will show you how to prepare your image for printing using free tools)</li>
 	<li>Your primary writing for this assignment will be for the object labels to accompany each item in the exhibit. To help you prepare to write in this potentially unfamiliar genre, please review <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VA_Gallery-Text-Writing-Guidelines_online_Web.pdf">the guidance prepared by the Victoria and Albert Museum</a>.</li>
</ul>
I will want to see a draft of your object labels during our individual conference so I can give you feedback.
<h3>Prepare your Classifications for WonderCat</h3>
We have been working all semester to build a spreadsheet of creative works, experiences, technologies, and illustrative features; this option for the final project asks you to revisit all of your contributions to that spreadsheet and refine them for submission to WonderCat. It’s possible you’ve already created an account and entered experiences into WonderCat and it’s also possible you don’t want to create a WonderCat account. You can pursue this project whether you make your work public or not. The goal will be to revisit each of your classification decisions, refine the quotation or paraphrase you’ve offered to illustrate your classifications, and make a few additional decisions:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>WonderCat Username</strong>: Even if you decide not to add your data to WonderCat, this is a useful exercise. Consider whether you want your data associated with your actual name or a pseudonym.</li>
 	<li><strong>A Blurb</strong>: Also called “back-cover copy,” a blurb is a short bit of promotional writing designed to entice people to read a story. It is not a summary or a synopsis; it shouldn't divulge what actually happens in the story. There are likely many different blurbs in the world for the stories you’ve written about this semester. Each time a new edition is published, a new blurb is created. For copyright reasons, we can’t reproduce the blurbs in WonderCat, but you can take a look at a few to get a sense of how they work. Think carefully about your goals for your blurb. If you decide to submit it to WonderCat, it will appear in a pop-up when users mouse over the title of the book.</li>
 	<li><strong>Your Classifications</strong>: The best way to do this is to revise your contributions to our shared spreadsheet. Try to make revisions before we meet for our individual conference—we can look closely at each of your choices and think through tricky decisions together.</li>
 	<li><strong>A Reflection</strong>: Making your experiences with creative works public might feel thrilling. It might also feel terrifying. I want to encourage you to write about the experience of making your experiences known to the world (hypothetically or for real). Explain how you made classification, feature, and blurb decisions and what you hope will come from your work on this project.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Final Exam</h1>
Our final exam will begin with an opportunity to share feedback on the final projects students have decided to share with the class. We will do this for no more than 20 minutes, allowing the rest of the time for the Final Exam, which is an open book exam. You can prepare for this exam by engaging with the work of the course all semester. For the exam, I will share a text published in the nineteenth century that should be unfamiliar to everyone in the class. Your task will be to read it, describe your experience of it, and describe everything you can about it, using the techniques you have learned this semester (actual reading, identification of generic features, Internet research, database research, etc.). If you turn something in, you will receive full credit on this exam. I use this exam primarily to assess how fully I've accomplished my goals for the course. You are doing the thinking and writing, but I’m the one being evaluated (by myself).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I experimented with this method first in a literature survey course, adapting a structure Angus Fletcher was using with MFA students. I've since adapted the method for three different courses. You can peruse the assignments in the Assignments in Context section of this book; I hope this organization illustrates how this method could be adapted to many types of courses, including a course focused on a specific genre or literary movement. The trick to eliminating the reading list is figuring out how to help students find "new-to-you texts" in the period, genre, movement, or author demographic being studied.
<h2>Frame the course as a research project</h2>
It is powerful to introduce students to literature as a technology that humans invented to respond to environmental problems. As they work to classify their experiences, students will learn about narrative technologies that they didn’t realize were at work in their favorite books and films. This empowering approach to literature is made even richer when we show students how their own experiences and hypotheses can contribute to the growing field of story science. Students have an opportunity to expand how scholars understand literature if they work hard to articulate their genuine reactions to real reading.
<h2>Help students set goals for the semester</h2>
I’ve realized that goal setting is an important first step when giving students more autonomy. Students wind up in our courses for all sorts of reasons, and they of course all have their own life and career goals. I like to encourage students to think of a literature course as an opportunity to encounter texts you wouldn’t choose on your own ("new-to-you texts"). When you’re given an opportunity to choose what you will read, you can decide to challenge yourself in a range of ways. This might mean tackling something that is unfamiliar and a little intimidating. It might mean reading everything you can find that uses a particular technology to better understand how it works. Or perhaps it means exploring texts that have prompted experiences associated with specific psychological benefits. I like to have this conversation with students after I describe the unique features of the course during the first class meeting.
<h2>Embrace creative writing</h2>
The assignments inspiring this course asked students to identify a literary blueprint and then try to use it themselves. I have tried to imagine ways for students to do these things in a literature course. I did these creative assignments alongside my students even though it was uncomfortable at first (I’ve never fancied myself a creative writer). After one semester of these experiments, I found myself thinking in terms of story as much if not more than argument. When I tried to write an introduction that would get students excited about selecting their own texts, I found myself imagining a transportation hub—The Station—where travelers can go wherever they want, whenever they want, by whispering the location into a window (see <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/nineteenth-century-literature#welcometothestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Welcome to The Station”</a>). And as we created WonderCat, a discovery tool that grows with each new story experience entered, I imagined a shop inside that station where employees help people search through huge card catalogs of travel experiences to find new places to visit—for free (see <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/nineteenth-century-literature#introducingwondercat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Introducing WonderCat”</a>).
<h2>Share your love of literature (but don’t expect students to appreciate the things you love)</h2>
It can be challenging to share enthusiasm for something you love with students who are uninterested (or looking at their phones…or sleeping). There are lots of approaches to this dilemma. I have colleagues who see it as a challenge and give a compelling performance for their students, arguing for the brilliance of the authors they’ve assigned (even, or perhaps especially, when they suspect students haven’t read). But I’ve always struggled to convey my enthusiasm when I can tell students aren’t into it. This changed dramatically when I started offering my own reading experiences as a model for what I wanted students to do with their chosen texts. I was able to describe the details I noticed without fearing that I would read them regurgitated back to me in an essay later in the semester. More importantly, because I didn’t feel the pressure to convince students to share my appreciation, I found myself sharing more and connecting with my students as a fellow reader. This became a rich antidote to the demoralizing experience of disengaged students.
<h2>Model the work you want students to do</h2>
Before giving each major assignment prompt, I did the assignment myself, drafting a new post about a text I was experiencing for the first time. This was time consuming, but I honestly think it was one of the most impactful choices I made. The first time I did this, I created a post about literature I had already read and wanted to tell students about. But, when I realized that I wanted to show students how I work through confusion while reading and uncertainty as I process my experiences, I shifted to chronicling my experience reading something new. I was introducing them to literature they might never read, and they were nevertheless curious about what it was in the text that prompted my experience (they even helped me get more specific with some very thoughtful questions-check out <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/algorithms-and-arts/2024/09/17/confusion-paranoia-and-empathy-in-the-terror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the insightful comments on my post about <em>The Terror</em></a>).
<h2>Ask students to start with something they already know</h2>
The strategy of teaching literature with student-selected texts is unfamiliar and can be a bit overwhelming for students at first. It helps tremendously if students get started by thinking about a story they're already familiar with. Each of the courses outlined below begin with a “getting started” assignment that asks students to identify stories that they’ve returned to repeatedly in their lives. In addition to allowing them to get started right away (that is, before they've read something new), this assignment helps each student identify specific experiences and narrative technologies that might inform their reading choices for the rest of the semester. Even if you want students to focus on written texts for the semester, it’s helpful to leave options open for the first assignment (let students choose a text, film, game, song, etc.).
<h2>Structure discussion around features that will be present no matter what is chosen</h2>
As I imagined teaching with this method, I anticipated (and mourned) the loss of class discussion. Though my class discussions weren’t going the way I hoped they would (very few students were coming to class with observations to kickstart discussion), I still wanted students to learn from each other. I was delighted to discover that it is absolutely possible to have a discussion about literature when students have read different texts. I have structured assignments around elements of narrative (storyworld, plot, character) specific genres (text, moving images, sound, etc.), and specific representations (predators, invasives, natural phenomena). I find the learning much richer with this shift of focus. We get a much better collective understanding of these elements, students take ownership of the creative works they bring into discussion, and everyone discovers new creative works they want to experience in the future.
<h2>Curate possibilities (students don't know what they don't know)</h2>
After my first semester teaching with this method, I realized that eliminating assigned reading left some students a bit stuck when it was time to decide what they would read. I dreamed of a tool that would allow students to see what other students had read, what experiences those stories had prompted, and the narrative technologies students identified in those stories. More specifically, I imagined a network graph that would illustrate the connections between specific students, the texts they'd chosen to read, and the experiences and technologies they reported for those texts. I found collaborators and we worked together to create a discovery tool called WonderCat. This tool is described and incorporated into the resources of this book, but it is certainly not the only way to help students discover new texts to experience. If you've ever had trouble deciding what to include on a reading list, imagine the power of including everything you might possibly include in the class on a list that you share with students at the start of the semester. Even better, submit your own experiences with these texts to WonderCat so everyone using the tool can learn about them.
<h2>Adjust your expectations</h2>
It is possible that you will dissolve into the ether if your students don't experience the words and paragraphs written by the author you've devoted your life to studying. I think it’s more likely that you’ll figure out what exactly it is that you want students to get out of reading that author and set them on a path to choose them on their own. Two realizations have given me comfort as I've shifted to this method in the classroom:
<ul>
 	<li>This method is a corrective. I still very much want to assign texts and dream of a future where I can teach a literature course in which we follow a reading list. But when I do this, I will not be inviting students to argue for their interpretation during class. Instead, I will invite everyone to share the technologies they see at work in the assigned text. I’m sure some differences in interpretation will emerge, but that will not be the primary goal.</li>
 	<li>My students <em>are</em> choosing to read things that I have assigned in the past. Brontë, Dickens, Kafka, Joyce, etc. And when I next teach "Representations of Nature," I’m eager to curate narrative representations of nature so students can have my guidance as they select what to read in the course. I will be adding them to WonderCat before the class begins.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Give students an opportunity to share their writing with each other</h2>
The assignments included in this book ask students to compose posts for a website that can be kept private during the semester. Students were able to choose whether they wanted to share discussion reflections and formal assignments with me or the entire class. As seen in <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/nineteenth-century-literature#finalproject" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the final project options</a>, the course website also allows students to prepare their writing to be fully public at the end of the semester. This option for students to share their writing with classmates is an important feature of the course. The website also makes it possible for the instructor to read what students are thinking at the end of class discussions. Discussion reflections (described in the “Preparation and Participation” assignment below) reveal where students are getting stuck by asking them to share thoughts they might not volunteer during discussion. OpenLab is the open-source platform we use to build WordPress sites for courses at our university. If you'd like to learn more about using this tool, check out <a href="https://commonsinabox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the description of OpenLab from the developers</a> (you can also see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x-ms9qK5xrc?si=lhm9kP64hN6OnHdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview I did about getting OpenLab established at our university</a>).
<h2>Provide feedback on student inquiry rather than the genre being produced</h2>
The primary method for assessing student learning in many literature courses is an argument-driven paper offering original literary analysis. This is, I think, why the most assigned author in the English literature syllabi collected by <a href="https://analytics.opensyllabus.org/singleton/fields?id=28">the Open Syllabus Project</a> is Cathy Birkenstein, the author of <em>They Say/I Say</em> (Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> is the second most assigned text). I don’t think we need students to produce well-formed interpretive arguments to be engaged in the work of the literature classroom, and I think our emphasis on these papers is one of the reasons students try to find replacements for the work of actually reading assigned texts. The assignment prompts in this book very clearly communicate that I am not looking for a “typical English paper.” What I didn’t anticipate is that I would need to refine my method of providing feedback to reinforce where I want students to put their energy. Each of the courses below includes a “Classifying Experiences and Technologies” assignment—something I ask students to do after they get my feedback on their work. Here’s what I say in that assignment:
<blockquote><em>After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.</em></blockquote>
Here are some of the tips I find myself sharing with students as I provide feedback:
<ul>
 	<li>We’re not writing reviews, though people reading what we’re writing might decide to check something out that they might not have encountered otherwise.</li>
 	<li>Include lots of direct quotation. If you’re saying that a text has a specific feature, make sure to give an example of that feature.</li>
 	<li>Write to a general audience—clarity is a priority!!</li>
 	<li>Share <em>your</em> experience of the text! Give details.</li>
 	<li>Share your best sense of how the writer prompted an emotional response you had. If you want to research how others have explained the writer’s technique, go for it. Do make sure to cite what you read.</li>
</ul>
One reviewer asked what genre I am asking students to produce. I didn’t know the answer to this question when I first started this project, but now I think I do. Students are producing narratives of their reading experiences, and I am deliberately not specifying the genre they should produce. I am also not evaluating how well their choices work because doing so would render them useless as an assessment tool. These narratives allow me to see what students are thinking. That is, they enable <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/basics/formative-summative.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formative rather than summative assessment</a>. The beauty of sharing this writing with classmates and maybe even the world is that these narratives also have power beyond that momentary assessment. They can inspire other students. They can themselves provoke a feeling of wonder because they are filled with insightful literary analysis (often spontaneous). I think it’s very important that students be encouraged to narrate in a way that feels most comfortable. There is no right way to narrate your reading experience and thinking too much about the shape might get in the way of learning from the act of narrating.

On a related note, I think this project is revealing the limitations of generic classification as a tool for navigating the vast quantity of literature humans have created. Genre classifies the whole, but narrative technologies allow us to focus on individual parts. As I give feedback on a student’s post, I might even comment on the narrative technology I see them using, not to suggest that they do it differently, but to call attention to the choice they’ve made. It's empowering for students to recognize that these are tools anyone can use.
<h2>Your expertise goes in a different place</h2>
I can’t know what students will choose, which means I can’t possibly be an expert on every work of literature they’ll bring into the classroom. And this is a good thing. Instead of using a lecture or the Socratic method as students first encounter a text, my expertise is useful after students have read and crafted their posts. After they have put their ideas together, it is my role to offer contexts that might help them extend their investigation. For some students, that might mean responding to their enthusiasm and pointing them to additional resources. For others, I can offer context that might turn confusion into curiosity…or frustration into resilience.

Several reviewers commented on the sociohistorical context of literature and if/where students learn about this. I think my primary response is that they learn about this through feedback on their posts. Through this feedback, I encourage them to explore these contexts more fully in a final project. The key, I think, is that students develop a curiosity about the context that surrounded the creation of the thing they have experienced. Sometimes this happens as students read, and they ask questions in class or search online for resources that will help them understand what is going on. I want to create space for that to happen naturally if it will. Sometimes that curiosity doesn’t emerge organically and a student responds to a text without considering the moment in which it was created. Ideally, they share their process of curiosity and discovery in their post and I’m able to offer additional resources based on my expertise.

On the subject of expertise, I should note that I have used this method when the parameters of a course are limited to my area of study and I have used it when the parameters are wide open (creative works created at any time and in any form). I find myself most comfortable as a teacher when I already know about the texts students are reading and I think—if we’re concerned about the reputation of our profession—restricting the course to my own areas of expertise makes it more likely that students will recognize my expertise and see me as a resource as they read. But if I set aside my professional affiliation (literature professor) and focus more on my pedagogical training, I have to acknowledge the power of modeling the journey from ignorance to understanding. I have found students more engaged and empowered when they see me unafraid to admit my ignorance. If an instructor is comfortable stepping outside their area of expertise, there is tremendous pedagogical benefit to modeling for students how you are making sense of the unfamiliar thing your student has selected.
<h2>A student can be engaged without finishing the book</h2>
In the middle of my first semester experimenting with these methods, I was disappointed to learn that some students weren't finishing the books they’d chosen (they shared this during class discussion). At first, I thought this meant the experiment had been a failure. A well-designed course, I believed, would result in students motivated enough to work through confusion or boredom to finish what they started. I immediately started designing a final project that would require students to finish at least one text by the end of the semester. I shared this with Angus and was surprised when he said he didn't think this was necessary. Experiencing a work of literature, he said, doesn't have to mean finishing the entire work. I was thoroughly convinced that I did not need an argument-driven essay to know that students were doing the work of the course, but it was harder for me to let go of the expectation that students should read through difficulty. I think this stems from my early training as a teacher coming from David Bartholomae and Anthony Petrosky's <em>Ways of Reading</em>, which I used when teaching composition for the first time. The introduction for students includes a rationale for the challenging texts in the anthology, which included Paolo Freire, Gloria Anzaldúa, and Michel Foucault:
<blockquote>When we chose the selections for this textbook, we chose them with the understanding that they were difficult to read. And we chose them knowing that students were not their primary audience (that the selections were not speaking directly to you). We chose them, in other words, knowing that we would be asking you read something you were most likely not prepared to read. But this is what it means to be a student and it was our goal to take our students seriously. Students have to do things they are not ready to do; this is how they learn. Students need to read materials that they are not ready to read. This is how they get started; this is where they begin.[footnote]Bartholomae, David, and Anthony Petrosky, <em>Ways of Reading: An Anthology for Writers</em> (Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2008), 12. I purchased a used copy of the eighth edition to revisit this guidance, but the twelfth (current) edition contains the same sentences.[/footnote]</blockquote>
As a new graduate student entering the classroom for the first time, I internalized this paragraph. I then developed my own version of this advice, guiding students (in academic writing courses and in literature courses) to push through difficulty even when it isn’t fun. But I’m starting to think differently about the goals of a literature course in a moment when university students increasingly view the liberal arts core curriculum as an obstacle to their professional goals. If a student in this situation deliberately selects a challenging literary work and finds it unpleasant, I want to help them process that experience rather than insist that they overcome it. I now make it clear that students don't have to finish the book to complete the assignment, and find that they are much more willing to share where they got stuck in their posts. Often, they're able to classify the experience (confusion, frustration, etc.) and locate what features of the text prompted that experience. This is another example of meeting students where they are rather than insisting they perform at the level I expect. I do still want students to read through difficulty, but I'm going about it in a different way.
<h2>Be a human teacher</h2>
Some teachers are worried about being replaced by robots. I think this is only a threat if we teach like robots. I’ve become increasingly aware of the pressures that have been turning human teachers into robots since I started teaching (well before generative AI). One pressure that I resist is a too-rigid curriculum that leaves no room for improvisation. This pressure is strongest for contingent faculty, who are often hired to deliver a course that they didn't design and given no opportunities to shape the curriculum. It is disappointing when faculty in leadership positions treat the humans teachers they hire like automatons; a worthwhile change would be to engage all faculty equally in discussions about curriculum and pedagogy (this is a change for chairs and coordinators to make, though it is something contingent faculty might request; chairs and coordinators often can't control the pay rate, but they can shape the culture of a department). Another pressure is grades, which turn real learning into a transactional exchange. And another is learning management systems that compartmentalize the many dynamic components of a course, making the human interaction hard to see. I'm regularly looking for ways to humanize the interactions I have with students, and open pedagogy and ungrading are two of the ways I try to do this work. My thinking about grades changed dramatically when I read Susan D. Blum’s <em>Ungrading: Why Rating Students Undermines Learning (and What to Do Instead) </em>in 2020. My ideas have been further refined by Joshua R. Eyler’s <em>Failing Our Future: How Grades Harm Students, and What We Can Do about It</em> (2025) and Emily Pitts Donohoe’s Substack called <a href="https://emilypittsdonahoe.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unmaking the Grade</a>. What I have learned (through many experiments and failures with ungrading) is that I <em>can</em> hold students accountable for the intellectual work of the assignment without grading the product. In my courses, students who don't meet assignment requirements are given feedback and a new deadline to meet those requirements. Those who do this work receive full credit on the assignment. Those who don't revise receive no credit for the assignment. Some students don’t revise, and this is the primary reason a student wouldn't receive an A in my course (coming to class unprepared is the second most common reason). Most students correct course when I reach out for the first time with some variation on “Your post doesn’t yet meet requirements, but I describe in my feedback video the things you can do to make revisions.” I should note that I’ve also started setting up one-on-one conversations with students who are struggling. Usually there’s something much bigger than my assignment that they’re struggling with, and I can try to connect them with resources.
<h2>Make this your own</h2>
Maybe your metaphor for reading isn't The Station as I’ve envisioned it, but something else. Maybe the units and assignments focus on aspects of literature other than what I’ve imagined so far. I have openly licensed this book so you can make it your own. I'd love to hear what you've done with it and link to your adaptation in a future edition of this book. Practically speaking, adapting this book can be as simple as copying the assignments into a Word document or learning management system and altering them before distributing to your students. You might also want to <a href="https://guide.pressbooks.com/chapter/clone-a-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a clone</a> of this entire book using the Pressbooks software, making adjustments in your copy.

One anonymous reviewer asked how the frameworks and approaches in this book might "overlap, align, or contradict what might be considered cultural studies, feminist studies, class studies, or other theoretical approaches that have been important shapers of literature courses over the past half century." I think these strategies could be adapted quite productively for courses like this. The place I would begin would be in curating a set of texts you would typically assign and thinking about the technologies you think the authors are using to respond to events in the world (or, if the course is organized around theory, what technologies might be associated with the theoretical concepts you want to cover). You will likely find that you need terms that aren't already in the glossary of narrative technologies (though moral suasion, I voice, and logic will likely be relevant). Students could select one theoretical or creative work to read for each unit organizing the course (maybe those units are organized around a specific historical event or a specific theory). When it's time for class discussion (or even a large lecture that invites student involvement via live polling software?) students would come to class with passages they flagged while reading. I think students are most likely to come to class prepared if they're able to choose the texts they're reading (perhaps from a list you've curated for them with the option to bring in something new). Students are even more likely to actually read if they need to hand in a narrative of their reading experience that includes their best attempt at classifying their experiences and the technologies prompting those experiences. Most importantly, students would be tasked with doing real work: considering how their chosen text interacts with the event or theory (or something else); this shift that gives them more to do (and more freedom to own that work).

Another reviewer, Lauren Beck, reinforced my hunch that this pedagogy could be useful in first-year writing courses. I am adapting these assignments for the academic writing courses I’ll be teaching this year. I’m focusing specifically on developing glossaries for experiences with sources (understanding, curiosity, confusion, skepticism, etc.) and another taxonomy for technologies at work in sources (thesis statement, example, I voice, citation, etc.). This is an interesting shift for me. I have always drawn on my training in writing pedagogy when teaching literature. Like many literature professors, I learned how to teach academic writing through explicit training to work as a TA in graduate school and this shaped the way I taught literature. I think this is why I assumed the best way to “learn” about literature was to write an argument about it. It’s an unexpected benefit that my re-visioning of literature pedagogy might enliven my courses in academic writing. This feedback reminded me that of course we can experience wonder when reading academic writing. I'm hopeful that this helps me finally make some progress in helping students through the process of reading and using the sources they find for their projects. This has always been the hardest thing to do.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first time I taught literature without a reading list, I thought it was my job to make personalized recommendations for my students. This was an overwhelming task that my students helped me realize was unnecessary (they did this primarily by not reading the things I suggested). Though most didn’t want my recommendations, they did report feeling stuck when it was time to decide what they would read. I winced as I observed them Googling for ideas, and then I had a vision. I dreamed of a tool that would allow students to see what other students had read and what experiences and narrative technologies they had encountered with those stories. More specifically, I imagined a network graph that would illustrate the connections between specific students, the texts they'd chosen to read, and the experiences and technologies they reported for those texts.

My thinking was that if students could see what other students had read and also see the experiences those students reported having with those stories, this could inspire some enthusiasm for the LIMITLESS ENJOYMENT TO BE FOUND IN THE ARCHIVE OF HUMAN CREATIVITY!! (not to overstate the power of reading or anything). I found collaborators and we are working together to create WonderCat.

The structure for this tool was inspired by the invention-finding method at the center of Angus Fletcher’s <em>Wonderworks</em>. In his introduction, Fletcher describes this method by narrating Aristotle’s departure from Plato’s Academy over two thousand years ago. Aristotle, Fletcher explains, renounced "the academy’s commitment to reason and reason alone" and:
<blockquote>Ambled off to chat with beekeepers, vivisect bird eggs, catalogue mortal emotions, classify wildflowers, and chronicle stage shows, laying the empirical foundations of zoology, physiology, psychology, botany, and dramaturgy. And somewhere in the course of these investigations into the nuts and bolts of life, he discovered the method for finding all of literature’s inventions. […] Aristotle’s account of the invention-finding method appears in a cragged paragraph that falls about one-third of the way into a treatise known as the Poetics. […] As knotty as the prose paragraphs of the Poetics can be, they manage to preserve the invention-finding method with enough clarity for us to recover its essential action. That action consists of two linked steps: first, identify what literature does, and second, work backward to uncover how literature does it. The what is the specific psychological effect of a literary work; an effect that’s typically linked to emotion. The how is the unique literary invention that drives the effect; an invention that’s usually engineered from one of the core elements of narrative: plot, character, storyworld, and narrator. In theory, this two-step process of reverse engineering literature is simple. In practice, it’s a bit more difficult. But the more we practice, the easier it gets (14-15).</blockquote>
<em>Wonderworks</em> models a new (but actually very old) way of engaging with literature; this is what I most appreciated when I first read it. Fletcher’s chapters aren't organized around interpretive arguments. Each chapter introduces a literary technique through the story of its invention and then outlines experiences that technique can prompt in the humans engaging with it. And the end of almost every chapter comes with a suggestion of other stories that use the same technique. By organizing chapters around specific inventions, Fletcher reveals connections between creative works emerging from different historical moments. One of my favorite chapters explores the experience of bias reduction through the technique of the double alien, which Ursula K. Le Guin wielded masterfully in <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>, an innovation on Jonathan Swift's use of the technique in <em>Gulliver's Travels</em>. At the end of the chapter, Fletcher suggests other narratives that use the same technique:
<blockquote>You can find Ursula Le Guin’s bias-busting blueprint in Paul Theroux’s <em>The Great Railway Bazaar: By Train Through Asia</em> (1975), Marjane Satrapi’s <em>Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return</em> (2000), and many other modern travelogues. Or if you’d like to take the next step into science fiction and discover how new narrative technologies can manipulate our expectations, try playing the video game <em>Bioshock</em> (2007) (325).</blockquote>
While Fletcher’s chapters provide specific examples of literary inventions and suggest other more recently published stories using those inventions, I recognized that this was only the beginning. I realized that the effects and techniques Fletcher identified (I call them experiences and technologies) could form the basis of a tool that could expand to include experiences and technologies from many readers. In this structure, Darwin’s use of suspense in <em>On the Origin of Species</em> could be connected to Jordan Peele’s <em>Get Out</em>.
<h2>A Relational Database</h2>
When I first had this idea, I didn’t know how to create a network graph. I learned quickly that we would need a relational database. We would essentially be creating lots of different tables (or spreadsheets) that would be linked by the terms in our controlled vocabularies (glossaries). We are chronicling the experience of building WonderCat in detail elsewhere, so I’ll just share here that it is designed to function in three interwoven ways.
<ul>
 	<li>First, it is a discovery tool. If you’re looking for something to read, you can peruse the visualizations in the tool to find stories according to the experiences they prompted and the technologies identified by WonderCat users. We are adding features that make it possible to filter creative works by publication dates and locations, making it more useful for classes focused on specific literary periods.</li>
 	<li>WonderCat is also an open pedagogy project. It is growing with user contributions. All users are encouraged to create an account and enter their story experiences. Each experience entered is included in the visualizations (unless the experience is set to private). WonderCat makes it possible for you to put yourself into the visualization to see how your experiences connect to other users. It also makes it possible for you to keep your own private set of nicely organized experiences with story.</li>
 	<li>Finally, the WonderCat editorial team publishes glossaries that are always expanding to more accurately describe the way literature works in the world. We recognize that the terms we currently have in our taxonomies do not capture the full range of human experiences with story (how could they?!), nor does it include every narrative technology that exists. WonderCat users are encouraged to propose new terms for these taxonomies and are credited publicly for their contributions at the website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not a Recommender System</h2>
WonderCat is a database, not a recommender system, but my description of relational data might sound a little like the systems that deliver recommendations in streaming services and online shopping sites ("because you watched...", “customers who bought...also bought…”). The difference is that on those sites, the recommendations are computed with proprietary algorithms drawing on your behavior and demographic data. Those algorithms are built around assumptions about your identity and can’t know your actual experiences (if you want to think more about how algorithms use your behavior and demographics to make predictions about you, check if you have a <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google adsense profile</a>). I think it’s better to have some agency in these choices and so I’m quite proud that WonderCat is a database that you can search, not a recommender system making predictions about what you will like.
<h2>Analog WonderCat</h2>
One final note on WonderCat for those who want less technology in the classroom, not more. I've used these strategies in a course where students had no access to computers or the Internet, and we created an analog version of WonderCat together. In our Experiences binder, we placed dividers for each term in the taxonomy and each student prepared the pages for the experiences they wanted to include. Here's the template I printed:

[caption id="attachment_606" align="aligncenter" width="385"]<img class=" wp-image-606" src="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/12/2024/12/Revised-after-class-59-232x300.png" alt="" width="385" height="498" /> A template that students filled out by hand[/caption]

The collaborative design project was great fun and the result was a physical discovery tool. If you do something similar or create your own version of WonderCat, please get in touch (I really want a glossary of sonic technologies!!).

<strong>A note on the first iteration of this course: </strong>This course was co-taught with Dr. Kim Craig (a psychology professor who regularly teaches "Cognitive Neuroscience") for students in the university honors program (honors courses fulfill core curriculum requirements; this course fulfilled competency 9, perspectives on creative arts). We decided to restrict student selections to written texts after the first assignment, but otherwise placed no restrictions on what students chose to read. This worked very well, we think because we emphasized that students should be selecting texts outside their typical reading preferences. I am working with Dr. Craig to prepare additional resources that will help students find and understand research articles in the field of cognitive neuroscience. This will help me feel confident to teach this course alone in the future. Even when co-taught, our goal was not to get students to a place where they could confidently design an experiment with cognitive neuroscience methods. Our goal instead was to encourage students to consider the complex ways the human brain engages with story.

<h1>Welcome to the Station (in-class activity)</h1>
<em>This piece, which I read aloud on the first day of class, is an effort to help students grasp the power of narrative by imagining a transportation hub in which you can go anywhere you want by simply speaking the name of your chosen destination into a magical window. It encourages students to imagine their own version of this station and then introduces the paradox of choice in the Internet age, which has given rise to recommender systems that remove the dilemma of making a choice (and steal autonomy in the process). Many students appreciate this opportunity to listen and imagine, but some have shared that closing their eyes makes it harder to envision what I'm describing. I bring hard copies so students can read along if they want.</em>

In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Closing your eyes can make it easier to imagine the space, but you can also read along if you think that will work better.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a transportation hub filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Villette.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Villette.

Now the glass is glass again. See? (tap tap tap). You can tap it too if you want.

Oh, and if you look quickly across the station in that back corner you can see a whole family leaping together through a window! You can absolutely go on a journey with other people.

It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make-believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that you find wonderful. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. I used a window, but what will you use as a portal? Remember, through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. Trust me, I get it. And I’ll just mention (because I think it will put your mind somewhat at ease) you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Preparation and Participation</h1>
I think class discussion is one of the most important elements of this course and it works best if we all come prepared. You should prepare for each class by selecting something specific you want to bring into the discussion (this might be something you've read or something you've written, depending on the moment in the semester). Before the start of class, I’ll ask each of you to add things you want to discuss to Our Doc (a shared Word Online document). As we begin discussion, I’ll ask you to put devices away and get out your notebooks. I will do my best on the class computer to pull up texts, passages, and random things that come up as the discussion happens. I’ll also give you time at the end of class to compose a discussion reflection on our course website. You should use this as an opportunity to share what you took away from the discussion, whether you voiced your ideas during class or not. Your goal is to write quickly and informally to capture emerging ideas. By the end of the allotted time (or a bit after class if you need more time), I will ask you to publish your post or keep it private (I’ll be able to see it either way). In the gradebook, I will give you a completion grade for your preparation work (added to Our Doc) and for your participation work (entered as a discussion reflection).
<h1>Getting Started (Assignment #1)</h1>
For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select a story that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. Making such a selection can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust me, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Beowulf</em> and from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Bridgerton</em>) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers, etc.) who draw on an ever-expanding set of narrative technologies as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore something you have genuinely enjoyed. Once you’ve put a name to the experiences you’ve had with stories in the past, you can find more stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences (and remember, that’s the point of this assignment).

Once you’ve decided on the story you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right setup to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements for this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the narrative technology the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any other assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think one or more stories work. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). It’s unlikely you’ll figure everything out, and that’s okay. If you do find a source that offers an explanation (like an article or a blog post), make sure to cite it!<a id="repeatedprocess"></a>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe your Experience</strong></h2>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. If possible, include who or what introduced you to the story. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year. Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced when you encountered the story.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Classify Your Experience</strong></h2>
Now that you’ve described your experience, you’re going to consider whether others have had that same experience with a story. This might be a little challenging because it’s not what we typically do with literature in a classroom. You might be expecting to <em>interpret</em> literature in a course like this, perhaps using class discussion to debate the meaning of Frankenstein’s relationship with the monster he created in Mary Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>.

But with this assignment, I’m not asking you to find out if someone has interpreted the story you’ve chosen in the same way you have. Instead, I’m asking you to determine if others have had a similar experience <em>with any work of literature</em>. You can see in the example experiences below that an experience is different than an interpretation (and wildly different works of literature can prompt similar experiences):
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table class="has-fixed-layout">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Confusion</td>
<td>The feeling of being bewildered or unclear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection</td>
<td>Feeling linked or bonded to others in community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Courage</td>
<td>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Curiosity</td>
<td>When we feel we have some idea about an answer, but are unconfident about what that answer is. The active form of wonder. Where the first form of wonder is passive (essentially pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you), curiosity is active.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>The feeling of understanding another person’s actions. You may not condone the actions or identify with the person, but you accept that their actions weren’t wrong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wonder</td>
<td>An uplifting emotional experience of discovery. As Fletcher puts it, wonder is “life through the eyes of a child” (16). It is like pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you (84).</td>
</tr>

You can peruse the full list of experiences we’ve classified so far in the <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/back-matter/experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiences Glossary</a>.

Instead of interpreting, we’re going to use a scientific method similar to what biologists use when they work from observations in the field toward taxonomic classification of species. If they observe an organism that hasn’t already been classified, they get to name a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). But they might find that what they’ve observed is not a new species (it’s actually just a funny-looking zebra). We’ll discuss new experiences as a class, helping you determine if you’ve actually had a new experience or found a funny-looking zebra. If the experience you had isn’t in the list above, you can give it a name and, if you want, <a href="https://forms.newhaven.edu/view.php?id=379445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propose it for inclusion in WonderCat</a> so it can be represented in our list of experiences going forward.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe the Features Prompting your Experience</strong></h2>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features, so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld, for example), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible. Here are examples of direction quotation and paraphrase:

Direct quotation from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

“My rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow…I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.”

Paraphrase from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

The story is presented from a variety of narrative perspectives: the explorer, Dr. Frankenstein, and his monster.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try to Determine the Narrative Technology That Created the Feature</strong></h2>
As you try to figure out which features of the story prompted your experience, try also to imagine the narrative technology the author used to create those features. I say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to remember that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your experience and who is most likely responsible for it? Below, I describe the four basic elements of narrative (you can click to look at narrative technologies in each category)
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#storyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Character</strong></h3>
This is pretty straightforward. These are the characters doing things in the story. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some character technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!

Once you’ve done your best to identify the technology that prompted your experience, you’re done! Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technology linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore in this assignment (I’d suggest no more than three). You can organize your post according to the steps outlined above, as I’ve done in my example post, or you can write a post that includes all that information but presents it in a way that you think will be more compelling to your classmates. You have the option to share your post with your classmates or keep it private so I’m the only one who sees it.

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with the class?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don’t need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment. You can also keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in if you are so inclined.</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this?</strong> This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%. This sort of project is likely new to you, so things will be confusing! Do your best and I will give you feedback so you understand the expectations going forward.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on Assignment #1)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Experiments on Emotion (in-class activity)</h1>
After you submit your first post, we will spend time in class looking at the experiences and technologies in WonderCat and considering how those experiences might be beneficial for readers. We will review strategies for searching through our library databases to learn how these experiences have already been studied experimentally. We will workshop discoveries in class and you will submit your findings as a new experience in WonderCat (with the option to keep your submission private).
<h1>Introducing WonderCat</h1>
So, now you’ve done assignment one. You’ve described the emotional experiences prompted by a story that has been meaningful in your life. Maybe you’ve identified specific narrative technologies that prompted your experiences. Good work. Now it’s time to go back to The Station. Before we go back, though, let’s think a little about our first visit to The Station. Because that was a story.

I created The Station to function as a metaphor. I wanted you to feel a sense of wonder as I described a magical place that could take you on a journey anywhere without buying a ticket, going through security, or waiting at a departure gate. In this metaphor I created, I took the act of experiencing a story and stretched it into an actual journey. I’m not the first person to do this, and most people respond to The Station by telling me that it reminded them of platform 9 ¾ in <em>Harry Potter</em> or another fantastical story in which characters could teleport to another place with relative ease. In my version, whispering the name of the place you want to go into a window is like saying the name of the story you want to experience, whether that’s opening up a book and reading the first line, pressing play to start a film, or sitting in a theater as the lights dim and the actors emerge onto the stage.

But like all metaphors, mine glosses over some of the realities. It is true that the Internet makes it possible for you to access a digital version of almost any book in the world in a matter of seconds. But not everyone knows that this is possible (you often don’t even have to go to the library to access their books!). And of course, not everyone has access to the Internet. Accessing a book is slightly more challenging than walking up to a window and whispering a destination, but I still marvel at the magic of libraries. They may not have everything, but they can get almost anything if you ask.

In addition to this feeling of wonder, I also wanted you to feel a bit of the inevitable anxiety that emerges when your options are so open. Humans have not always had near-immediate access to so many stories. In the earliest universities, only the professor had access to the texts he was teaching. A significant part of teaching in the medieval period involved making a text available so students could create a copy, complete with notes on the relevant contexts that they could also only learn directly from the professor. But you don’t need to be in a university to access literature now, nor do you need a professor to tell you the historical context necessary to make sense of unfamiliar texts. You can read anything, watch anything, play anything. The options are endless! And that is delightful. But also overwhelming. This class is meant to help you make the most of your near-infinite access to literature. And so, let’s go back to The Station to think through this metaphorically. Please get out a sheet of paper. Close those eyes or read along. Let’s go back through the radiator.

I want us to visit The Station again to explore a shop designed to help you find new places to visit. I think you’re going to love it. Remember, you should be imagining The Station you created when we first visited.

Oh, I do want to answer one question you might’ve had when we last visited because I get this question a lot. If you step through one of the magical windows to leave for your journey, how do you return? The answer is...

Giant Bank Tubes.

That’s right, those clear pneumatic tubes that take the little canister from your car into the bank and then from the bank back to your car. You’ll return from your journey in an enormous one of those. It doesn’t take long at all, and each tube lands gently in the center of the station, after which the traveler just opens the door and steps out. Another common question: when can you come back? You can come back anytime you want.

The shop is just over here in the corner. If you were just passing by, you’d probably think it was a typical airport bookstore. One way you can tell that it’s different is that there’s no checkout register (because there’s nothing for sale here). You might notice that there are people with navy blue aprons helping guests and working at typewriters positioned near each cabinet. These are Wonder Cataloguers and their job is to help you decide where you want to go. Right over there, for example, that little girl is asking the tall gentleman with the silver hair—his name is Philippe—a question. I didn’t hear what she said, but he’s taking her across the room to find something. You might notice now that the shop is not actually filled with bookshelves. Instead, the space is filled with card catalog cabinets—the kind that used to help people find books in libraries. They’re not used much these days (library holdings are mostly organized digitally), which makes it even more exciting to be surrounded by them here (I mean, for me. I love old things).

Each of the little drawers has a brass-bordered label indicating which cards are arranged alphabetically inside: “Technology, An-Bo” or “Experience, Co-Gr.” Philippe is taking the little girl across the room and—oh, he’s so thoughtful—placing a step stool so she can reach one of the upper drawers in the section labeled “Destination, Do-En.” Let’s go eavesdrop. If you all hide here behind this catalog, I’ll tell you what’s happening.

They’ve found the card they were looking for and Philippe is saying “I think you’re going to love it.” He’s explaining that she can look at the white cards labeled “Earthsea” to see all the experiences people have logged when they’ve taken that journey. He’s showing her that there are quite a few cards for Earthsea, actually, because lots of people have gone there (each card can fit about four unique experiences). As he copies down the information from the Earthsea cards for her on a sheet of paper, he’s clarifying that everyone is different and that there’s really no telling how it will be for her. He just handed her the sheet of paper and said (I hear Philippe say this a lot) “no matter what, come back and tell us what it was like for you.” He points over to a big desk in the corner of the room, right next to the self-serve coffee and tea station. A few guests are having a cup of coffee while sitting at the desk, writing on small blue cards. Right next to the desk is a small slot in the wall labelled “Add New Experience.” The Wonder Catalogers take those new submissions and add the experiences to the appropriate cards. You can see Cheryl over there is pulling a blue card from her apron. She’s finding the right drawer and then the correct white card and then pulling it out so she can type more information on it. She’s going to put it right back in the same spot when she’s done.

Sweet gig, right? I mean, again, for me. I love old technologies. I don’t want to disappoint you, but I should clarify that you’re not allowed to use the typewriters. Unless you become a Wonder Cataloger, that is. It’s a coveted position (people wait years for the opportunity). One of the many perks is that you get to use the typewriters. And you get to hang out with Philippe at the WonderCat holiday party.

I’m going to give you some time to peruse the shop on your own. I want you to look around a bit and think about what you want to find. Will you look at the catalog for technologies to see what is listed for the narrative technology you found in our first assignment? Or maybe you’ll see what journeys have made people feel courageous. As soon as you’re done looking around this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you’ve imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Storyworld (assignment #2)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and technologies you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. You might look especially for texts that are noted to use narrative technologies that authors use when constructing storyworlds, but this isn’t required. Every story has a storyworld for you to think about.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <a href="#repeatedprocess" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong></a>. You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

Part 1: Draft your post on course website
<ul>
 	<li>Describe your experiences</li>
 	<li>Classify your experiences</li>
 	<li>Describe the features prompting your experiences</li>
 	<li>Try to determine the narrative technologies used to create the features you describe (if possible, isolating technologies used to construct the storyworld)</li>
</ul>
Part 2: Revise your post, making sure it includes
<ul>
 	<li>Any sources clearly cited (hyperlinks for online sources and in-text citations for print sources) with a list of works cited at the end.</li>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (usually an image associated with the story you’re writing about)</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image and any other images included in post.
<ul>
 	<li>“caption” field should include an attribution statement (<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TASL guidance here</a>)</li>
 	<li>“alternative text” field should provide a summary of what is in the image</li>
 	<li>“description” field should include the URL for the image file you downloaded</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don't need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment (you should only create notes for the part of the text you are able to read). Keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in and consider expanding your edition at the end of the semester (a more substantial tour guide edition is one option for the final project).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with classmates?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #2)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Experiments on Emotion (in-class activity)</h1>
After you submit your first post, we will spend time in class looking at the experiences and technologies in WonderCat and considering how those experiences might be beneficial for readers. We will review strategies for searching through our library databases to learn how these experiences have already been studied experimentally. We will workshop discoveries in class and you will submit your findings as a new experience in WonderCat (with the option to keep your submission private).
<h1>Remove the Technology (in-class activity)</h1>
Spend some time in class trying to isolate a section of the story you've read for use in an experiment. Create a copy of this section and remove the technology that you've isolated (if you can). What did you have to do to remove this technology? Could these two passages (the original and the modified) prove useful in an experiment on the effect of this technology on the human brain?
<h1>Character (Assignment #3)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. You might look especially for texts that are noted to use narrative technologies that authors use when creating characters, but this isn’t required. All stories have characters.

<h1>Final Project</h1>
You’ve written four posts this semester. Throughout this experience, I have encouraged you to capture and share your responses to literary works that you are experiencing for the first time. As we conclude the semester, I want to give you an opportunity to revisit the literature you’ve read and expand on the discoveries you made through the first four assignments.

Since the start of the semester, our course website has been set to private, meaning that only the students enrolled in the course can see the site. You have chosen between publishing your work (making it visible to your classmates) or keeping it private (so only I can see it). At the end of the semester, I will make our entire website public and you can choose to have your posts included in that public site (visible to anyone who finds our website) or set to private (still only visible to me). You also can set a password for any posts you want to share with family and friends (but not the general public).
<h2><strong>Possibilities</strong></h2>
Select one of the following options for the final project!
<h3>Revise Three of your Posts for Publication on our Course Website</h3>
Revise three or more of your posts for inclusion in our course website, which I will make fully public at the end of the semester. If you choose this option, you will need to pay careful attention to attribution statements for images and other content created by other people. <strong>I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to publish any of these posts to receive full credit on this assignment.</strong>

<strong>Please add the "final project" category to posts that you are revising for this assignment.</strong>

It can be hard to understand how citation and attribution statements can work together in a publication. I created <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w_-nwr-ersn0/citations-and-attribution-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presentation to help with this</a>. Remember that when you incorporate an image alongside the text of your project, you should include a caption below the image that includes an attribution statement. To craft an attribution statement, follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidance at this Creative Commons article</a>. If you use the image in a context where captions are not possible (if it is included as a featured image that doesn’t display a caption), include the attribution statement under an “Attribution Statement” heading at the bottom of your page. Note that you can include copyrighted images if you are offering commentary on that image in your post because of <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fair use limitation on copyright</a>. You still need to include an attribution statement making it clear who holds the copyright (I typically add “all rights reserved” after the name of the copyright holder).

I will want to see at least one completely revised post when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback. More is better!
<h3>Prepare your Classifications for WonderCat</h3>
We have been working all semester to build a spreadsheet of creative works, experiences, technologies, and illustrative features; this option for the final project asks you to revisit all of your contributions to that spreadsheet and refine them for submission to WonderCat. It’s possible you’ve already created an account and entered experiences into WonderCat and it’s also possible you don’t want to create a WonderCat account. You can pursue this project whether you make your work public or not. The goal will be to revisit each of your classification decisions, refine the quotation or paraphrase you’ve offered to illustrate your classifications, and make a few additional decisions:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>WonderCat Username</strong>: Even if you decide not to add your data to WonderCat, this is a useful exercise. Consider whether you want your data associated with your actual name or a pseudonym.</li>
 	<li><strong>A Blurb</strong>: Also called “back-cover copy,” a blurb is a short bit of promotional writing designed to entice people to read a story. It is not a summary or a synopsis; it shouldn't divulge what actually happens in the story. There are likely many different blurbs in the world for the stories you’ve written about this semester. Each time a new edition is published, a new blurb is created. For copyright reasons, we can’t reproduce the blurbs in WonderCat, but you can take a look at a few to get a sense of how they work. Think carefully about your goals for your blurb. If you decide to submit it to WonderCat, it will appear in a pop-up when users mouse over the title of the book.</li>
 	<li><strong>Your Classifications</strong>: The best way to do this is to revise your contributions to our shared spreadsheet. Try to make revisions before we meet for our individual conference—we can look closely at each of your choices and think through tricky decisions together.</li>
 	<li><strong>A Reflection</strong>: Making your experiences with creative works public might feel thrilling. It might also feel terrifying. I want to encourage you to write about the experience of making your experiences known to the world (hypothetically or for real). Explain how you made classification, feature, and blurb decisions and what you hope will come from your work on this project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design an Experiment</h3>
<div>

(co-written with Dr. Kim Craig)

This option is a thought experiment; a process of discovery and critical thinking that is designed to allow you to dream big but also think through the practical realities that challenge researchers.

</div>
<div>

You will come up with a research question of interest to you, investigate what researchers have done in the past regarding your topic, and design the research materials you will need for your hypothetical experiment. You may work individually or in a group for this project. Since this is a thought experiment, imagine you have access to any equipment you want (even technology that doesn't yet exist).

<strong>Research Question: </strong>State your question explicitly. It will likely change as you work through several drafts of this project.

<strong>Literature Review</strong>: Summarize the articles you find that speak to some aspect of your research question (at least three from different research groups). Existing research may fit with your goals and your question, or it might be challenging to find something relevant. We will workshop things in class as you search for and read published research.

<strong>Materials:</strong> To study narrative experimentally, you will need to design the narratives that your hypothetical human subjects will encounter. What materials are needed to answer your research question? Will you write them yourself or curate existing works?

<strong>Course Description: </strong>How do we decide which creative works to engage with? How did people discover what they loved before the Internet? How often is an algorithm influencing what we choose to watch, read, or listen to? What is the relationship between recommender systems and human reviewers? Are social media influencers critics? These are some of my questions. I’ve designed this course so it is also (even more!) shaped by the questions that emerge for you about this topic. This might take us in a direction I can’t predict (I hope this happens). There is no requirement that you memorize or become an expert in any of the concepts we discuss, though I suspect we will all leave feeling more aware of the network of algorithms that shape our experiences. I do strongly recommend that you bring your own interests, experiences, and questions to the work of the course. You will complete your assignments by engaging with creative works that you have chosen. My taste is probably not your taste, but I am endlessly fascinated by the things my students find beautiful, compelling, and thought-provoking.

<strong>A note on various iterations of this course: </strong>I designed this course in 2021 for <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/connected-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Connected Core</a> in collaboration with colleagues from music and engineering. I was interested in (but not an expert on) algorithms and machine learning. For the <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/algorithms-and-the-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first iteration of the course</a>, I selected resources on algorithms, recommender systems, and machine learning to put on my reading list (I still assigned reading then). Very few students read those pieces, but we still managed to have high-level discussions about student experiences with these technologies. Once I discovered the method described in this book, I decided to build the course around student experiences with creative works <em>and</em> the discovery tools that recommended them. I didn’t ask students to read articles, but used the research I’d done to facilitate discussions about the creative works they were experiencing and the discovery technologies they used to find them. I hoped students would be eager to join me in designing alternatives to proprietary recommender systems, but that didn't emerge organically. I think what was missing was a clearly stated expectation that students expand their knowledge about how discovery technologies work. When I next teach this course, I am going to ask students to articulate questions about specific recommender systems and seek out reliable sources of information to answer those questions. I’ll make<a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/4759573/algorithms_and_the_arts/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> my curated list of resources available to them</a>, but I'll encourage them to draw on anything they find useful. Also, I should note that both times I’ve taught this course I’ve included assignments that focus on film and music (though I specialize in neither). The place where I’ve always felt most uncomfortable is when I’m teaching the unit on music because I’m not trained in sonic technologies (I dream of adding sonic technologies to WonderCat someday). The way I’ve handled this is that I work with students to create a list of questions for D. Edward Davis, my colleague in music who also teaches in The Connected Core. He has helped me and my students identify specific technologies (rhythms and chord progressions). If my goal were to show students the value of my discipline, it would probably be wise for me to focus only on literature in the course. But my goal is to help students think carefully about algorithms that are impacting their engagement with creative works (the goal of this interdisciplinary course), and including music and film makes the course more exciting for students.

<h1>Welcome to the Station (in-class activity)</h1>
<em>This piece, which I read aloud on the first day of class, is an effort to help students grasp the power of narrative by imagining a transportation hub in which you can go anywhere you want by simply speaking the name of your chosen destination into a magical window. It encourages students to imagine their own version of this station and then introduces the paradox of choice in the Internet age, which has given rise to recommender systems that remove the dilemma of making a choice (and steal autonomy in the process). Many students appreciate this opportunity to listen and imagine, but some have shared that closing their eyes makes it harder to envision what I'm describing. I bring hard copies so students can read along if they want.</em>

In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Closing your eyes can make it easier to imagine the space, but you can also read along if you think that will work better.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a transportation hub filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Villette.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Villette.

Now the glass is glass again. See? (tap tap tap). You can tap it too if you want.

Oh, and if you look quickly across the station in that back corner you can see a whole family leaping together through a window! You can absolutely go on a journey with other people.

It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make-believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that you find wonderful. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. I used a window, but what will you use as a portal? Remember, through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. Trust me, I get it. And I’ll just mention (because I think it will put your mind somewhat at ease) you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Preparation and Participation</h1>
I think class discussion is one of the most important elements of this course and it works best if we all come prepared. You should prepare for each class by selecting something specific you want to bring into the discussion (this might be something you've read or something you've written, depending on the moment in the semester). Before the start of class, I’ll ask each of you to add things you want to discuss to Our Doc (a shared Word Online document). As we begin discussion, I’ll ask you to put devices away and get out your notebooks. I will do my best on the class computer to pull up texts, passages, and random things that come up as the discussion happens. I’ll also give you time at the end of class to compose a discussion reflection on our course website. You should use this as an opportunity to share what you took away from the discussion, whether you voiced your ideas during class or not. Your goal is to write quickly and informally to capture emerging ideas. By the end of the allotted time (or a bit after class if you need more time), I will ask you to publish your post or keep it private (I’ll be able to see it either way). In the gradebook, I will give you a completion grade for your preparation work (added to Our Doc) and for your participation work (entered as a discussion reflection).
<h1>Getting Started (Assignment #1)</h1>
For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select a story that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. Making such a selection can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust me, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Beowulf</em> and from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Bridgerton</em>) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers, etc.) who draw on an ever-expanding set of narrative technologies as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore something you have genuinely enjoyed. Once you’ve put a name to the experiences you’ve had with stories in the past, you can find more stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences (and remember, that’s the point of this assignment).

Once you’ve decided on the story you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right setup to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements for this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the narrative technology the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any other assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think one or more stories work. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). It’s unlikely you’ll figure everything out, and that’s okay. If you do find a source that offers an explanation (like an article or a blog post), make sure to cite it! <a id="repeatedprocess"></a>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe your Experience</strong></h2>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. If possible, include who or what introduced you to the story. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year. Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced when you encountered the story.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Classify Your Experience</strong></h2>
Now that you’ve described your experience, you’re going to consider whether others have had that same experience with a story. This might be a little challenging because it’s not what we typically do with literature in a classroom. You might be expecting to <em>interpret</em> literature in a course like this, perhaps using class discussion to debate the meaning of Frankenstein’s relationship with the monster he created in Mary Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>.

But with this assignment, I’m not asking you to find out if someone has interpreted the story you’ve chosen in the same way you have. Instead, I’m asking you to determine if others have had a similar experience <em>with any work of literature</em>. You can see in the example experiences below that an experience is different than an interpretation (and wildly different works of literature can prompt similar experiences):
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table class="has-fixed-layout">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Confusion</td>
<td>The feeling of being bewildered or unclear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection</td>
<td>Feeling linked or bonded to others in community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Courage</td>
<td>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Curiosity</td>
<td>When we feel we have some idea about an answer, but are unconfident about what that answer is. The active form of wonder. Where the first form of wonder is passive (essentially pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you), curiosity is active.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>The feeling of understanding another person’s actions. You may not condone the actions or identify with the person, but you accept that their actions weren’t wrong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wonder</td>
<td>An uplifting emotional experience of discovery. As Fletcher puts it, wonder is “life through the eyes of a child” (16). It is like pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you (84).</td>
</tr>

You can peruse the full list of experiences we’ve classified so far in the <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/back-matter/experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiences Glossary</a>.

Instead of interpreting, we’re going to use a scientific method similar to what biologists use when they work from observations in the field toward taxonomic classification of species. If they observe an organism that hasn’t already been classified, they get to name a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). But they might find that what they’ve observed is not a new species (it’s actually just a funny-looking zebra). We’ll discuss new experiences as a class, helping you determine if you’ve actually had a new experience or found a funny-looking zebra. If the experience you had isn’t in the list above, you can give it a name and, if you want, <a href="https://forms.newhaven.edu/view.php?id=379445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propose it for inclusion in WonderCat</a> so it can be represented in our list of experiences going forward.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe the Features Prompting your Experience</strong></h2>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features, so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld, for example), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible. Here are examples of direction quotation and paraphrase:

Direct quotation from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

“My rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow…I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.”

Paraphrase from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

The story is presented from a variety of narrative perspectives: the explorer, Dr. Frankenstein, and his monster.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try to Determine the Narrative Technology That Created the Feature</strong></h2>
As you try to figure out which features of the story prompted your experience, try also to imagine the narrative technology the author used to create those features. I say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to remember that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your experience and who is most likely responsible for it? Below, I describe the four basic elements of narrative (you can click to look at narrative technologies in each category)
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#storyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Character</strong></h3>
This is pretty straightforward. These are the characters doing things in the story. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some character technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!

Once you’ve done your best to identify the technology that prompted your experience, you’re done! Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technology linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore in this assignment (I’d suggest no more than three). You can organize your post according to the steps outlined above, as I’ve done in my example post, or you can write a post that includes all that information but presents it in a way that you think will be more compelling to your classmates. You have the option to share your post with your classmates or keep it private so I’m the only one who sees it.

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with the class?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don’t need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment. You can also keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in if you are so inclined.</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this?</strong> This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%. This sort of project is likely new to you, so things will be confusing! Do your best and I will give you feedback so you understand the expectations going forward.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on Assignment #1)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Introducing WonderCat</h1>
So, now you’ve done assignment one. You’ve described the emotional experiences prompted by a story that has been meaningful in your life. Maybe you’ve identified specific narrative technologies that prompted your experiences. Good work. Now it’s time to go back to The Station. Before we go back, though, let’s think a little about our first visit to The Station. Because that was a story.

I created The Station to function as a metaphor. I wanted you to feel a sense of wonder as I described a magical place that could take you on a journey anywhere without buying a ticket, going through security, or waiting at a departure gate. In this metaphor I created, I took the act of experiencing a story and stretched it into an actual journey. I’m not the first person to do this, and most people respond to The Station by telling me that it reminded them of platform 9 ¾ in <em>Harry Potter</em> or another fantastical story in which characters could teleport to another place with relative ease. In my version, whispering the name of the place you want to go into a window is like saying the name of the story you want to experience, whether that’s opening up a book and reading the first line, pressing play to start a film, or sitting in a theater as the lights dim and the actors emerge onto the stage.

But like all metaphors, mine glosses over some of the realities. It is true that the Internet makes it possible for you to access a digital version of almost any book in the world in a matter of seconds. But not everyone knows that this is possible (you often don’t even have to go to the library to access their books!). And of course, not everyone has access to the Internet. Accessing a book is slightly more challenging than walking up to a window and whispering a destination, but I still marvel at the magic of libraries. They may not have everything, but they can get almost anything if you ask.

In addition to this feeling of wonder, I also wanted you to feel a bit of the inevitable anxiety that emerges when your options are so open. Humans have not always had near-immediate access to so many stories. In the earliest universities, only the professor had access to the texts he was teaching. A significant part of teaching in the medieval period involved making a text available so students could create a copy, complete with notes on the relevant contexts that they could also only learn directly from the professor. But you don’t need to be in a university to access literature now, nor do you need a professor to tell you the historical context necessary to make sense of unfamiliar texts. You can read anything, watch anything, play anything. The options are endless! And that is delightful. But also overwhelming. This class is meant to help you make the most of your near-infinite access to literature. And so, let’s go back to The Station to think through this metaphorically. Please get out a sheet of paper. Close those eyes or read along. Let’s go back through the radiator.

I want us to visit The Station again to explore a shop designed to help you find new places to visit. I think you’re going to love it. Remember, you should be imagining The Station you created when we first visited.

Oh, I do want to answer one question you might’ve had when we last visited because I get this question a lot. If you step through one of the magical windows to leave for your journey, how do you return? The answer is...

Giant Bank Tubes.

That’s right, those clear pneumatic tubes that take the little canister from your car into the bank and then from the bank back to your car. You’ll return from your journey in an enormous one of those. It doesn’t take long at all, and each tube lands gently in the center of the station, after which the traveler just opens the door and steps out. Another common question: when can you come back? You can come back anytime you want.

The shop is just over here in the corner. If you were just passing by, you’d probably think it was a typical airport bookstore. One way you can tell that it’s different is that there’s no checkout register (because there’s nothing for sale here). You might notice that there are people with navy blue aprons helping guests and working at typewriters positioned near each cabinet. These are Wonder Cataloguers and their job is to help you decide where you want to go. Right over there, for example, that little girl is asking the tall gentleman with the silver hair—his name is Philippe—a question. I didn’t hear what she said, but he’s taking her across the room to find something. You might notice now that the shop is not actually filled with bookshelves. Instead, the space is filled with card catalog cabinets—the kind that used to help people find books in libraries. They’re not used much these days (library holdings are mostly organized digitally), which makes it even more exciting to be surrounded by them here (I mean, for me. I love old things).

Each of the little drawers has a brass-bordered label indicating which cards are arranged alphabetically inside: “Technology, An-Bo” or “Experience, Co-Gr.” Philippe is taking the little girl across the room and—oh, he’s so thoughtful—placing a step stool so she can reach one of the upper drawers in the section labeled “Destination, Do-En.” Let’s go eavesdrop. If you all hide here behind this catalog, I’ll tell you what’s happening.

They’ve found the card they were looking for and Philippe is saying “I think you’re going to love it.” He’s explaining that she can look at the white cards labeled “Earthsea” to see all the experiences people have logged when they’ve taken that journey. He’s showing her that there are quite a few cards for Earthsea, actually, because lots of people have gone there (each card can fit about four unique experiences). As he copies down the information from the Earthsea cards for her on a sheet of paper, he’s clarifying that everyone is different and that there’s really no telling how it will be for her. He just handed her the sheet of paper and said (I hear Philippe say this a lot) “no matter what, come back and tell us what it was like for you.” He points over to a big desk in the corner of the room, right next to the self-serve coffee and tea station. A few guests are having a cup of coffee while sitting at the desk, writing on small blue cards. Right next to the desk is a small slot in the wall labelled “Add New Experience.” The Wonder Catalogers take those new submissions and add the experiences to the appropriate cards. You can see Cheryl over there is pulling a blue card from her apron. She’s finding the right drawer and then the correct white card and then pulling it out so she can type more information on it. She’s going to put it right back in the same spot when she’s done.

Sweet gig, right? I mean, again, for me. I love old technologies. I don’t want to disappoint you, but I should clarify that you’re not allowed to use the typewriters. Unless you become a Wonder Cataloger, that is. It’s a coveted position (people wait years for the opportunity). One of the many perks is that you get to use the typewriters. And you get to hang out with Philippe at the WonderCat holiday party.

I’m going to give you some time to peruse the shop on your own. I want you to look around a bit and think about what you want to find. Will you look at the catalog for technologies to see what is listed for the narrative technology you found in our first assignment? Or maybe you’ll see what journeys have made people feel courageous. As soon as you’re done looking around this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you’ve imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Technologies of Discovery (in-class activity)</h1>
After you have drafted and revised your first assignment, we're going to spend some time in class exploring the technologies of discovery that helped you find what you chose to write about. We'll look closely at the features of creative works that connect the data in those discovery tools (everything from adjectives to genres to user interactions) and brainstorm improvements to WonderCat or another discovery tool that you use regularly. You'll work on this a little on your own, and then we'll break into groups to start working on details. You can brainstorm revisions to WonderCat or another discovery tool you use regularly. You can start designing something that doesn't exist yet. We'll continue this thought experiment after each assignment and I'll ask you to reflect on what emerges during the final exam.
<h1>Film (assignment #2)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to watch one film or series you’ve never watched before (if you choose a series, your goal will be to watch at least three episodes–more if you’ve got the time). I’ll ask you to do things as you watch and after you watch to get the most out of this experience. An equally important task with this assignment is to chronicle exactly how you find this new thing to watch (this was a little hard to recall as we thought about story experiences from the past in assignment one, but you should be able to capture lots of details this time around). You might <strong>let the film or show find you</strong> (as a recommendation on your favorite streaming service) or perhaps <strong>you will find the film or show</strong> by looking into things that interest you (genre, technique, artist, etc.) or searching WonderCat. If you decide to seek something out, you can use the experiences and technologies you identified in the first assignment to assist in your search. Even if you selected a text or a game for the first assignment, there will be films and shows that use the same technologies and have prompted the same experiences.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <a href="#repeatedprocess" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>chronicle and process your experience in a post for our course website</strong>.</a> You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

<ul>
 	<li>Describe your experiences</li>
 	<li>Classify your experiences</li>
 	<li>Describe the features prompting your experiences</li>
 	<li>Try to determine the narrative technologies used to create the features you describe</li>
</ul>
Part 2: Revise your post, making sure it includes
<ul>
 	<li>Any sources clearly cited (hyperlinks for online sources and in-text citations for print sources) with a list of works cited at the end.</li>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (usually an image associated with the story you’re writing about)</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image and any other images included in post.

</ul>
<strong>FAQs</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m watching?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your viewing experience without looking at what others have said, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this as you narrate your viewing experience (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/algorithms-and-arts/category/film/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website I created with students last year</a> to see posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with classmates?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #2)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like.

<h1>Music (Assignment #3)</h1>
Your primary task with this assignment is to experience an album in a musical genre completely outside your usual listening preferences. I want you to find an artist you’ve never heard of before that creates music in a genre you’re unfamiliar with. I also want you to experience an entire album: a collection of audio recordings organized by an artist in a particular way (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/21/1057783216/adele-spotify-shuffle-30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read more about how Adele urged Spotify to make this easier here</a>). As you did with assignment two, I want you to chronicle exactly how you find and listen to this new music. You might <strong>let the music find you</strong> (it’s unlikely that the recommender systems you use regularly will give you something outside your typical listening habits, but there are other ways things can find you, like scanning on <a href="https://everynoise.com/engenremap.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Noise at Once</a>) or perhaps <strong>you will find the film or show</strong> by looking into things that you are curious about (genre, technique, artist, etc.). If you decide to seek something out, you can use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first two assignments to assist in your search. For example, is there music that can make you feel the way a horror film makes you feel? I also want you to explain exactly <strong>how</strong> you listened to the music. Were you able to stream it as a complete album? Did you pay to download the album onto a device? Did someone loan you a CD? Was the full album on YouTube? Did you try to stream the album from the public library (<a href="https://wm.catalog.lionlibraries.org/Union/Search?view=list&amp;showCovers=on&amp;lookfor=kay+flock&amp;basicType=Author&amp;searchSource=local" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I did!!</a>)? Did you buy a physical album!?! From <a href="http://merlesrecordrack.com/index.html#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a record store</a>?!

<h3>Prepare your Classifications for WonderCat</h3>
We have been working all semester to build a spreadsheet of creative works, experiences, technologies, and illustrative features; this option for the final project asks you to revisit all of your contributions to that spreadsheet and refine them for submission to WonderCat. It’s possible you’ve already created an account and entered experiences into WonderCat and it’s also possible you don’t want to create a WonderCat account. You can pursue this project whether you make your work public or not. The goal will be to revisit each of your classification decisions, refine the quotation or paraphrase you’ve offered to illustrate your classifications, and make a few additional decisions:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>WonderCat Username</strong>: Even if you decide not to add your data to WonderCat, this is a useful exercise. Consider whether you want your data associated with your actual name or a pseudonym.</li>
 	<li><strong>A Blurb</strong>: Also called “back-cover copy,” a blurb is a short bit of promotional writing designed to entice people to read a story. It is not a summary or a synopsis; it shouldn't divulge what actually happens in the story. There are likely many different blurbs in the world for the stories you’ve written about this semester. Each time a new edition is published, a new blurb is created. For copyright reasons, we can’t reproduce the blurbs in WonderCat, but you can take a look at a few to get a sense of how they work. Think carefully about your goals for your blurb. If you decide to submit it to WonderCat, it will appear in a pop-up when users mouse over the title of the book.</li>
 	<li><strong>Your Classifications</strong>: The best way to do this is to revise your contributions to our shared spreadsheet. Try to make revisions before we meet for our individual conference—we can look closely at each of your choices and think through tricky decisions together.</li>
 	<li><strong>A Reflection</strong>: Making your experiences with creative works public might feel thrilling. It might also feel terrifying. I want to encourage you to write about the experience of making your experiences known to the world (hypothetically or for real). Explain how you made classification, feature, and blurb decisions and what you hope will come from your work on this project.</li>

<h1>Final Exam</h1>
Describe a discovery technology that will best support a community of artists that you belong to or value. That might be comic book illustrators, as-yet-undiscovered hip-hop artists, romance novelists, or something else. Think specifically about ways you can help connect fans with the work these artists are producing.

Now describe a discovery technology that will best support a community of consumers/fans that you belong to or value.

Is there any difference between the design of these two technologies? If so, why?]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Course Description</strong>: As humans, we create representations of nature in a wide range of media and for many different purposes. Examples in the creative arts include travel writing, landscape painting, field recordings of birds, and wildlife documentaries. Representations of nature for the purposes of scientific understanding include the naming of plant and animal species and illustrations of biological processes. Scientific theories have emerged alongside photographs captured with powerful microscopes and telescopes.

By looking carefully at representations of nature and asking how and why they were created, we will tackle big questions: What are the limits of human perception? Is it only humans who represent the natural world? How has human technology aided us in perceiving and representing other species? These are some of my questions, but I’ve designed this course so it is shaped primarily by the questions that emerge for you about this topic.

There is no requirement that you memorize or become an expert in any of the concepts we discuss, though I suspect we will all leave feeling more aware of the ways humans have represented nature and how those representations shape our experiences of the world. I do strongly recommend that you bring your own interests, experiences, and questions to the work of the course. You will complete your assignments by engaging with representations that you have chosen. My hope is that the work you do in this course enriches future courses in the natural sciences and helps you cultivate your own approach to environmental stewardship.

<strong>A note on various iterations of this course:</strong> I designed this course for <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/connected-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Connected Core</a> in collaboration with faculty in English, music, and biology and environmental sciences. When <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/representations-of-nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I first offered the course in Fall 2023</a>, I was starting to recognize the importance of student agency, but I hadn't yet recognized the value of classifying experiences and technologies. The assignments I share here are revised, and I'll be using them when co-teaching this course with a biology professor for the honors program. I am hopeful that this collaboration will prompt further revisions and additional resources for this interdisciplinary course.

<h1>Welcome to the Station (in-class activity)</h1>
<em>This piece, which I read aloud on the first day of class, is an effort to help students grasp the power of narrative by imagining a transportation hub in which you can go anywhere you want by simply speaking the name of your chosen destination into a magical window. It encourages students to imagine their own version of this station and then introduces the paradox of choice in the Internet age, which has given rise to recommender systems that remove the dilemma of making a choice (and steal autonomy in the process). Many students appreciate this opportunity to listen and imagine, but some have shared that closing their eyes makes it harder to envision what I'm describing. I bring hard copies so students can read along if they want.</em>

In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Closing your eyes can make it easier to imagine the space, but you can also read along if you think that will work better.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a transportation hub filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Villette.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Villette.

Now the glass is glass again. See? (tap tap tap). You can tap it too if you want.

Oh, and if you look quickly across the station in that back corner you can see a whole family leaping together through a window! You can absolutely go on a journey with other people.

It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make-believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that you find wonderful. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. I used a window, but what will you use as a portal? Remember, through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. Trust me, I get it. And I’ll just mention (because I think it will put your mind somewhat at ease) you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Preparation and Participation</h1>
I think class discussion is one of the most important elements of this course and it works best if we all come prepared. You should prepare for each class by selecting something specific you want to bring into the discussion (this might be something you've read or something you've written, depending on the moment in the semester). Before the start of class, I’ll ask each of you to add things you want to discuss to Our Doc (a shared Word Online document). As we begin discussion, I’ll ask you to put devices away and get out your notebooks. I will do my best on the class computer to pull up texts, passages, and random things that come up as the discussion happens. I’ll also give you time at the end of class to compose a discussion reflection on our course website. You should use this as an opportunity to share what you took away from the discussion, whether you voiced your ideas during class or not. Your goal is to write quickly and informally to capture emerging ideas. By the end of the allotted time (or a bit after class if you need more time), I will ask you to publish your post or keep it private (I’ll be able to see it either way). In the gradebook, I will give you a completion grade for your preparation work (added to Our Doc) and for your participation work (entered as a discussion reflection).
<h1>Getting Started (Assignment #1)</h1>
For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select one representation of nature that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. Making such a selection can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust me, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Beowulf</em> and from <em>Hamlet</em> to <em>Bridgerton</em>) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers, etc.) who draw on an ever-expanding set of narrative technologies as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore something you have genuinely enjoyed. Once you’ve put a name to the experiences you’ve had with stories in the past, you can find more stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences (and remember, that’s the point of this assignment).

Once you’ve decided on the story you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right setup to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements for this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the narrative technology the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any other assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think one or more stories work. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). It’s unlikely you’ll figure everything out, and that’s okay. If you do find a source that offers an explanation (like an article or a blog post), make sure to cite it!<a id="repeatedprocess"></a>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe your Experience</strong></h2>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. If possible, include who or what introduced you to the story. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year. Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced when you encountered the story.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Classify Your Experience</strong></h2>
Now that you’ve described your experience, you’re going to consider whether others have had that same experience with a story. This might be a little challenging because it’s not what we typically do with literature in a classroom. You might be expecting to <em>interpret</em> literature in a course like this, perhaps using class discussion to debate the meaning of Frankenstein’s relationship with the monster he created in Mary Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>.

But with this assignment, I’m not asking you to find out if someone has interpreted the story you’ve chosen in the same way you have. Instead, I’m asking you to determine if others have had a similar experience <em>with any work of literature</em>. You can see in the example experiences below that an experience is different than an interpretation (and wildly different works of literature can prompt similar experiences):
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table class="has-fixed-layout">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Confusion</td>
<td>The feeling of being bewildered or unclear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection</td>
<td>Feeling linked or bonded to others in community.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Courage</td>
<td>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Curiosity</td>
<td>When we feel we have some idea about an answer, but are unconfident about what that answer is. The active form of wonder. Where the first form of wonder is passive (essentially pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you), curiosity is active.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>The feeling of understanding another person’s actions. You may not condone the actions or identify with the person, but you accept that their actions weren’t wrong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wonder</td>
<td>An uplifting emotional experience of discovery. As Fletcher puts it, wonder is “life through the eyes of a child” (16). It is like pausing in astonishment as a miracle washes over you (84).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can peruse the full list of experiences we’ve classified so far in the <a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/back-matter/experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiences Glossary</a>.

Instead of interpreting, we’re going to use a scientific method similar to what biologists use when they work from observations in the field toward taxonomic classification of species. If they observe an organism that hasn’t already been classified, they get to name a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). But they might find that what they’ve observed is not a new species (it’s actually just a funny-looking zebra). We’ll discuss new experiences as a class, helping you determine if you’ve actually had a new experience or found a funny-looking zebra. If the experience you had isn’t in the list above, you can give it a name and, if you want, <a href="https://forms.newhaven.edu/view.php?id=379445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propose it for inclusion in WonderCat</a> so it can be represented in our list of experiences going forward.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Describe the Features Prompting your Experience</strong></h2>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features, so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld, for example), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible. Here are examples of direction quotation and paraphrase:

Direct quotation from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

“My rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow…I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.”

Paraphrase from <em>Frankenstein</em>:

The story is presented from a variety of narrative perspectives: the explorer, Dr. Frankenstein, and his monster.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try to Determine the Narrative Technology That Created the Feature</strong></h2>
As you try to figure out which features of the story prompted your experience, try also to imagine the narrative technology the author used to create those features. I say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to remember that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your experience and who is most likely responsible for it? Below, I describe the four basic elements of narrative (you can click to look at narrative technologies in each category)
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storyworld</strong></h3>
The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#storyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Character</strong></h3>
This is pretty straightforward. These are the characters doing things in the story. Our <a href="https://unewhavendh.org/story-and-the-brain/technologies-by-element-of-narrative/#character" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative technologies glossary</a> includes some character technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not there, you can propose it as a new term!

Once you’ve done your best to identify the technology that prompted your experience, you’re done! Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technology linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore in this assignment (I’d suggest no more than three). You can organize your post according to the steps outlined above, as I’ve done in my example post, or you can write a post that includes all that information but presents it in a way that you think will be more compelling to your classmates. You have the option to share your post with your classmates or keep it private so I’m the only one who sees it.

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with the class?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don’t need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment. You can also keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in if you are so inclined.</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this?</strong> This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.

</ul>
<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on Assignment #1)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Introducing WonderCat</h1>
So, now you’ve done assignment one. You’ve described the emotional experiences prompted by a story that has been meaningful in your life. Maybe you’ve identified specific narrative technologies that prompted your experiences. Good work. Now it’s time to go back to The Station. Before we go back, though, let’s think a little about our first visit to The Station. Because that was a story.

I created The Station to function as a metaphor. I wanted you to feel a sense of wonder as I described a magical place that could take you on a journey anywhere without buying a ticket, going through security, or waiting at a departure gate. In this metaphor I created, I took the act of experiencing a story and stretched it into an actual journey. I’m not the first person to do this, and most people respond to The Station by telling me that it reminded them of platform 9 ¾ in <em>Harry Potter</em> or another fantastical story in which characters could teleport to another place with relative ease. In my version, whispering the name of the place you want to go into a window is like saying the name of the story you want to experience, whether that’s opening up a book and reading the first line, pressing play to start a film, or sitting in a theater as the lights dim and the actors emerge onto the stage.

But like all metaphors, mine glosses over some of the realities. It is true that the Internet makes it possible for you to access a digital version of almost any book in the world in a matter of seconds. But not everyone knows that this is possible (you often don’t even have to go to the library to access their books!). And of course, not everyone has access to the Internet. Accessing a book is slightly more challenging than walking up to a window and whispering a destination, but I still marvel at the magic of libraries. They may not have everything, but they can get almost anything if you ask.

In addition to this feeling of wonder, I also wanted you to feel a bit of the inevitable anxiety that emerges when your options are so open. Humans have not always had near-immediate access to so many stories. In the earliest universities, only the professor had access to the texts he was teaching. A significant part of teaching in the medieval period involved making a text available so students could create a copy, complete with notes on the relevant contexts that they could also only learn directly from the professor. But you don’t need to be in a university to access literature now, nor do you need a professor to tell you the historical context necessary to make sense of unfamiliar texts. You can read anything, watch anything, play anything. The options are endless! And that is delightful. But also overwhelming. This class is meant to help you make the most of your near-infinite access to literature. And so, let’s go back to The Station to think through this metaphorically. Please get out a sheet of paper. Close those eyes or read along. Let’s go back through the radiator.

I want us to visit The Station again to explore a shop designed to help you find new places to visit. I think you’re going to love it. Remember, you should be imagining The Station you created when we first visited.

Oh, I do want to answer one question you might’ve had when we last visited because I get this question a lot. If you step through one of the magical windows to leave for your journey, how do you return? The answer is...

Giant Bank Tubes.

That’s right, those clear pneumatic tubes that take the little canister from your car into the bank and then from the bank back to your car. You’ll return from your journey in an enormous one of those. It doesn’t take long at all, and each tube lands gently in the center of the station, after which the traveler just opens the door and steps out. Another common question: when can you come back? You can come back anytime you want.

The shop is just over here in the corner. If you were just passing by, you’d probably think it was a typical airport bookstore. One way you can tell that it’s different is that there’s no checkout register (because there’s nothing for sale here). You might notice that there are people with navy blue aprons helping guests and working at typewriters positioned near each cabinet. These are Wonder Cataloguers and their job is to help you decide where you want to go. Right over there, for example, that little girl is asking the tall gentleman with the silver hair—his name is Philippe—a question. I didn’t hear what she said, but he’s taking her across the room to find something. You might notice now that the shop is not actually filled with bookshelves. Instead, the space is filled with card catalog cabinets—the kind that used to help people find books in libraries. They’re not used much these days (library holdings are mostly organized digitally), which makes it even more exciting to be surrounded by them here (I mean, for me. I love old things).

Each of the little drawers has a brass-bordered label indicating which cards are arranged alphabetically inside: “Technology, An-Bo” or “Experience, Co-Gr.” Philippe is taking the little girl across the room and—oh, he’s so thoughtful—placing a step stool so she can reach one of the upper drawers in the section labeled “Destination, Do-En.” Let’s go eavesdrop. If you all hide here behind this catalog, I’ll tell you what’s happening.

They’ve found the card they were looking for and Philippe is saying “I think you’re going to love it.” He’s explaining that she can look at the white cards labeled “Earthsea” to see all the experiences people have logged when they’ve taken that journey. He’s showing her that there are quite a few cards for Earthsea, actually, because lots of people have gone there (each card can fit about four unique experiences). As he copies down the information from the Earthsea cards for her on a sheet of paper, he’s clarifying that everyone is different and that there’s really no telling how it will be for her. He just handed her the sheet of paper and said (I hear Philippe say this a lot) “no matter what, come back and tell us what it was like for you.” He points over to a big desk in the corner of the room, right next to the self-serve coffee and tea station. A few guests are having a cup of coffee while sitting at the desk, writing on small blue cards. Right next to the desk is a small slot in the wall labelled “Add New Experience.” The Wonder Catalogers take those new submissions and add the experiences to the appropriate cards. You can see Cheryl over there is pulling a blue card from her apron. She’s finding the right drawer and then the correct white card and then pulling it out so she can type more information on it. She’s going to put it right back in the same spot when she’s done.

Sweet gig, right? I mean, again, for me. I love old technologies. I don’t want to disappoint you, but I should clarify that you’re not allowed to use the typewriters. Unless you become a Wonder Cataloger, that is. It’s a coveted position (people wait years for the opportunity). One of the many perks is that you get to use the typewriters. And you get to hang out with Philippe at the WonderCat holiday party.

I’m going to give you some time to peruse the shop on your own. I want you to look around a bit and think about what you want to find. Will you look at the catalog for technologies to see what is listed for the narrative technology you found in our first assignment? Or maybe you’ll see what journeys have made people feel courageous. As soon as you’re done looking around this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you’ve imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.
<h1>Improving WonderCat with Wikidata (in-class activity)</h1>
After you submit your first post, we will spend time in class looking at the experiences and technologies in WonderCat and considering how those experiences might be beneficial for readers. We will then check to see if the representation of nature you've written about is in Wikidata and if it is noted to depict the natural element that it does. We will workshop discoveries in class and you will submit your findings as a new experience in WonderCat (with the option to keep your submission private).
<h1>Predators (assignment #2)</h1>
Humans often represent carnivorous species as predators, occasionally to glorify their power and the fear they inspire in us. We are going to explore how trends in the representation of predators impact our relationship with other species.

After exploring how a variety of species have been represented as predators by scientists (consider the use of the word to classify insects in <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/onhistorynatural00swairich/onhistorynatural00swairich/page/114/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On the History and Natural Arrangement of Insects</a></em>) and artists (from the creators of <em>Jurassic Park</em> to <em>Jaws</em>), our third assignment asks you to find a new-to-you representation of a species that has been categorized as a predator (or a representation of the concept of predation) that you would like to experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and technologies you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. I will help you filter WonderCat results for specific representations of predators or predation.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <a href="#repeatedprocess" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong>.</a> You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details.

 	<li><strong>Should I choose something short so I can finish reading in time?</strong> You don't need to finish reading the text you select in order to complete this assignment (you should only create notes for the part of the text you are able to read). Keep reading after you’ve turned this assignment in and consider expanding your edition at the end of the semester (a more substantial tour guide edition is one option for the final project).</li>
 	<li><strong>Should I do research on what I’m reading?</strong> Only if you want to. You can process your reading experience without looking at what others have said about the text, but some students like getting the perspective of others. If you do look at secondary sources, please mention this in your reading experience section (even if you don’t wind up citing the sources)</li>
 	<li><strong>So, this isn’t a typical “English paper”? </strong>No, it isn’t. There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with me (and your classmates!).</li>
 	<li><strong>Can you share an example of what a finished product is supposed to look like? </strong>Yes! You can check out this page to see a variety of posts written in response to this assignment prompt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do I have to share my post with classmates?</strong> You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me (set your post to private if you only want me to see it).</li>
 	<li><strong>How will you grade this? </strong>This assignment is graded on a pass/fail basis. If you engage with the task and turn in a project, you will get 100%.</li>

<h1>Classifying Experiences and Technologies (responding to feedback on assignment #2)</h1>
After you submit your post, I will read it and prepare feedback for you. This won’t be the kind of feedback where I tell you if what you’ve done is right or wrong (these are your experiences, after all). Instead, my feedback will help you brainstorm the best language to describe your experience, get more specific about the features you observed, and explore if the narrative technologies you’ve identified already exist in WonderCat. I will do this by reading your post aloud, responding to your ideas and asking questions about your experiences and the specific features you mention. I want you to think of this video as me continuing the conversation you started by writing your post. With this assignment, I’m asking you to continue the conversation by responding to my feedback and making classification decisions for the experiences and technologies mentioned in your post.

Please create a word document responding to my feedback with your own commentary, questions, and final classification decisions. You can use <a href="https://unhnewhaven-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/misbell_newhaven_edu1/ETeKx4nlzbJHvkctG-NDEyQBNZ9RLpIAqHOp_TwoeCPOxg?e=8bFNs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this document as a template</a> if you would like. Upload that document to Canvas by the deadline. This assignment is graded pass/fail. If you engage with the task, respond to my feedback, and make final classification decisions by the deadline, you will get 100%.
<h1>Improving WonderCat with Wikidata (in-class activity)</h1>
After you submit your first post, we will spend time in class looking at the experiences and technologies in WonderCat and considering how those experiences might be beneficial for readers. We will then check to see if the representation of nature you've written about is in Wikidata and if it is noted to depict the element of predation that it does. We will workshop discoveries in class and you will submit your findings as a new experience in WonderCat (with the option to keep your submission private).
<h1>Invasives (Assignment #3)</h1>
After exploring how a variety of species have been represented as invasive (or not) by scientists (like invasive ecologists describing jumping worms or starlings) and artists (like the photographer Søren Solkær), our fourth assignment asks you to find representations of species that have been categorized as invasive (or a representation of the concept of invasiveness) that you would like to like to experience.

Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. I will help you filter WonderCat results for specific representations of invasive species.

You will follow the same steps as you did in assignment one to <a href="#repeatedprocess" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>chronicle and process your reading experience in a post for our course website</strong></a>. You can return to the prompt for "Getting Started” if you’re fuzzy on the details. We’ll be following these same steps for the third and fourth assignments this semester, so this will start to feel familiar

Part 1: Draft your post on course website
<ul>
 	<li>Describe your experiences</li>
 	<li>Classify your experiences</li>
 	<li>Describe the features prompting your experiences</li>
 	<li>Try to determine the narrative technologies used to create the features you describe (if possible, isolating technologies used to create one or more characters)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Natural Phenomena (Assignment #4)</h1>
Why does the wind blow? What creates waves? Why do plants stretch toward the light? What are those lights in the night sky?

Humans represent natural phenomena according to their understanding of the world, and we make sense of the world in a multitude of ways. Greek myths about monsters trapped beneath mountains offer one explanation for volcanic eruptions, geological charts offer a different explanation, and nature documentaries offer still another take on their power.

Your primary task with this assignment is to read one new text you’ve never read before that depicts a natural phenomenon. You’ll do things as you read and after you read to get the most out of this reading experience. If you’re not sure what you want to read, I encourage you to use the experiences and techniques you identified in the first assignment to search WonderCat for ideas. I will help you filter WonderCat results for specific representations of natural phenomena.

<h1>Improving WonderCat with Wikidata (in-class activity)</h1>
After you submit your first post, we will spend time in class looking at the experiences and technologies in WonderCat and considering how those experiences might be beneficial for readers. We will then check to see if the representation of nature you've written about is in Wikidata and if it is noted to depict the element of invasiveness that it does. We will workshop discoveries in class and you will submit your findings as a new experience in WonderCat (with the option to keep your submission private).
<h1>Final Project</h1>
You’ve written four posts this semester. Throughout this experience, I have encouraged you to capture and share your responses to literary works that you are experiencing for the first time. As we conclude the semester, I want to give you an opportunity to revisit the literature you’ve read (finishing texts you didn’t have time to finish earlier in the semester) and expand on the discoveries you made through the first four assignments.

Since the start of the semester, our course website has been set to private, meaning that only the students enrolled in the course can see the site. You have chosen between publishing your work (making it visible to your classmates) or keeping it private (so only I can see it). At the end of the semester, I will make our entire website public and you can choose to have your posts included in that public site (visible to anyone who finds our website) or set to private (still only visible to me). You also can set a password for any posts you want to share with family and friends (but not the general public).
<h2><strong>Possibilities</strong></h2>
Select one of the following options for the final project!
<h3>Revise Three of your Posts for Publication on our Course Website</h3>
Revise three or more of your posts for inclusion in our course website, which I will make fully public at the end of the semester. If you choose this option, you will also need to pay careful attention to attribution statements for images and other content created by other people. <strong>I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to publish any of these posts to receive full credit on this assignment.</strong>

<strong>Please add the "final project" category to posts that you are revising for this assignment.</strong>

It can be hard to understand how citation and attribution statements can work together in a publication. I created <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w_-nwr-ersn0/citations-and-attribution-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presentation to help with this</a>. Remember that when you incorporate an image alongside the text of your project, you should include a caption below the image that includes an attribution statement. To craft an attribution statement, follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidance at this Creative Commons article</a>. If you use the image in a context where captions are not possible (if it is included as a featured image that doesn’t display a caption), include the attribution statement under an “Attribution Statement” heading at the bottom of your page. Note that you can include copyrighted images if you are offering commentary on that image in your post because of <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fair use limitation on copyright</a>. You still need to include an attribution statement making it clear who holds the copyright (I typically add “all rights reserved” after the name of the copyright holder).

I will want to see at least one completely revised post when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback. More is better!
<h3>Propose a New Unit for our Course</h3>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>Propose a new unit for inclusion in this course and create an example post to introduce the concept to your classmates (in the spirit of “What are Predators?” and “How we talk about Invasives”). The final project should include the post to kickstart the unit and the assignment prompt for the unit (both can be in a single post). This does not need to become public. I considered, but did not yet develop, the following topics that you are welcome to play around with if they are of interest:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>The Universe</li>
 	<li>Non-Human Communication</li>
 	<li>Non-Human Perception</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prepare 3-4 representations for display in the third floor hallway of Harugari Hall (and elsewhere, if you want!).</h3>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
 	<li>This might be the featured images you selected for the first four assignments, or it might be new representations (or some new, some old). Each representation should be accompanied by an object label, which does not need to be formatted as a table, but should include all information we have been putting in object labels and have a clear goal of helping viewers interpret what you have selected. This will be public (but could be displayed in a space other than Harugari, if you want). I will arrange to have the images and object labels printed before the final exam. That is, I will coordinate the exhibit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prepare your Classifications for WonderCat</h3>
We have been working all semester to build a spreadsheet of creative works, experiences, technologies, and illustrative features; this option for the final project asks you to revisit all of your contributions to that spreadsheet and refine them for submission to WonderCat. It’s possible you’ve already created an account and entered experiences into WonderCat and it’s also possible you don’t want to create a WonderCat account. You can pursue this project whether you make your work public or not. The goal will be to revisit each of your classification decisions, refine the quotation or paraphrase you’ve offered to illustrate your classifications, and make a few additional decisions:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>WonderCat Username</strong>: Even if you decide not to add your data to WonderCat, this is a useful exercise. Consider whether you want your data associated with your actual name or a pseudonym.</li>
 	<li><strong>A Blurb</strong>: Also called “back-cover copy,” a blurb is a short bit of promotional writing designed to entice people to read a story. It is not a summary or a synopsis; it shouldn't divulge what actually happens in the story. There are likely many different blurbs in the world for the stories you’ve written about this semester. Each time a new edition is published, a new blurb is created. For copyright reasons, we can’t reproduce the blurbs in WonderCat, but you can take a look at a few to get a sense of how they work. Think carefully about your goals for your blurb. If you decide to submit it to WonderCat, it will appear in a pop-up when users mouse over the title of the book.</li>
 	<li><strong>Your Classifications</strong>: The best way to do this is to revise your contributions to our shared spreadsheet. Try to make revisions before we meet for our individual conference—we can look closely at each of your choices and think through tricky decisions together.</li>
 	<li><strong>A Reflection</strong>: Making your experiences with creative works public might feel thrilling. It might also feel terrifying. I want to encourage you to write about the experience of making your experiences known to the world (hypothetically or for real). Explain how you made classification, feature, and blurb decisions and what you hope will come from your work on this project.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There are four basic elements to a story: narration, storyworld, plot, and character. When you're learning how to identify technologies that prompt your experiences with story, it can be helpful to understand the role of each element and peruse example technologies associated with each element.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narration</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All of the choices about how the story is told. Sometimes the narrator is a character in the story, sometimes not. When you’re looking at a film or video game, narration involves the camera angles, music, and voiceover narration. The table below includes some narration technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not here, you can propose it as a new term!

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The fictional world in which the story takes place. Even if the story is nonfiction, the world the narrator creates to tell it is best understood as a representation of the real world. Here are some storyworld technologies, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not here, you can propose it as a new term!

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plot</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The plot is what actually happens in the story, though the narrator may present it out of order, through a variety of perspectives, or in some other non-linear telling. Here are some plot technologies to consider, though there are many more. If you identify one that is not here, you can propose it as a new term!

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're used to organizing class around the discussion of an assigned text, it can be hard to imagine what you would do in a class in which everyone is reading something different. Below are some examples of things I do with a full class in my courses, organized according to particular moments in the semester. If you find strategies that work in your courses and want to include them here, please get in touch!
<h2>At the start of the semester</h2>
Before the class begins, I send students an e-mail introducing myself and explaining how the first assignment will work. This lays the groundwork for the first class meeting:
<blockquote><em>I’m excited to meet with you in Harugari Hall next week when our class officially begins. </em><em>For most of this course, you will be reading stories you’ve never read before. But we’re not going to do that right away. As we get started, you’re going to select a story that you’ve already read (or watched or played)–one that prompted a memorable experience. I’m writing now to give you a heads up about our first assignment because there might be a book, film, video game, or album that you want to track down before heading to campus. You don't need to decide now what you'll use, but I encourage you to think about it and come to campus with some options that might work. </em><em>You will need to be able to quote from the thing you choose to meet the requirements for this assignment. </em><em>Please let me know if you have any questions!</em></blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>As students introduce themselves during the first class meeting, I invite them to share whatever they feel comfortable sharing about one of the stories they might use for the first assignment. Some might not want to share much and that's okay.</li>
 	<li>During the second class meeting, students are invited during class to look through the glossaries and try to identify at least one experience that they’ve had with a creative work and one technology they've encountered in a creative work. I invite students to share an experience they'd like to have and a technology they'd like to encounter.</li>
 	<li>Sometime in the first week or so (usually after I introduce the idea of "the station"), I devote class time to helping students apply for a library card or decide what bookstore they plan to use to purchase the things they want to read during the semester. In an ideal world, this activity is accompanied by a trip to a local public library so students can finalize the sign-up process and learn how they can use online apps like hoopla or libby to access books during the semester.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When students have started reading, but haven't yet submitted a draft</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students arrive and open their laptops to add to our shared document one feature (quotation or paraphrase) from the creative work they have selected and, if they want, an experience they had with the creative work.</li>
 	<li>All students are invited to bring their examples into class conversation, collaborating with classmates to understand the complexities of the focus for the day (“was your experience prompted by the way your story was narrated ?” or “what is allowed and what isn’t allowed in the storyworld you’re encountering?”).</li>
 	<li>Before the end of class, students open their devices and complete a discussion reflection to post on our course website (setting it to private or sharing with classmates).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>When students have just drafted a post</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students arrive and open their laptops to add to our shared document one feature (quotation or paraphrase) from the creative work they have selected. This might be the same one they added the previous class, but it might also be something new or revised.</li>
 	<li>Devices are put away.</li>
 	<li>Two students share their full draft with the class in a revision workshop. I like to determine the two students in advance, usually by writing specific students and asking if they'd be willing to workshop their draft. Though they're hesitant to volunteer, they're often willing if I explain how much the class will benefit from seeing their approach to the assignment.</li>
 	<li>All students are invited to bring their examples into the discussion (accessed through the shared document since devices are still away).</li>
 	<li>Before the end of class, students open their devices and complete a discussion reflection to post on our course website (setting it to private or sharing with classmates).</li>
</ul>
<h2>When students have started revising their post but it isn't yet submitted</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students arrive and open their laptops to add at least one story-experience-technology-feature grouping from their draft to our shared spreadsheet. This often prompts questions from students who hadn't yet selected a specific experience or technology term. I leave more time for this activity, talking directly with students who haven't added something to the shared spreadsheet. I also ask students to take note of something in the spreadsheet they'd like to bring into discussion and flag it with a comment.</li>
 	<li>Devices are put away.</li>
 	<li>I show students how to filter the spreadsheet and sort by experience terms and technology terms for discussion.</li>
 	<li>All students are invited to share their thoughts about the process of classifying experiences and isolating technologies at work in their stories. I draw on the comments if students are hesitant to speak.</li>
 	<li>Before the end of class, students open their devices and complete a discussion reflection to post on our course website (setting it to private or sharing with classmates).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>When students have completed a creative assignment</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students arrive with a draft of the creative activity they’ve started in advance. They open their laptops to add to our shared document information about the specific narrative technology (reality shifter, I voice, plot twist, etc.) they’ve decided to experiment with and their goals.</li>
 	<li>Devices are put away.</li>
 	<li>Students bring their ideas into a full-group discussion about the challenges of the creative activity.</li>
 	<li>Students work in pairs to test what they’ve drafted.</li>
 	<li>Volunteers have an opportunity to share sections of their draft with the full class in a revision workshop.</li>
 	<li>Before the end of class, students open their devices and complete a discussion reflection to post on our course website (setting it to private or sharing with classmates).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>When students have gotten feedback on their post</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Students arrive and open their laptops to revise the story-experience-technology-feature groupings they've added to our shared spreadsheet. I often give significant time for this because they now have my feedback on the classification decisions they made in their post and have lots to consider.</li>
 	<li>Devices are put away.</li>
 	<li>Students bring their experiences into a full-group discussion about the challenges of classifying their experiences with creative works.</li>
 	<li>WonderCat "Enter an Experience" demo, inviting students to do this when they’re ready.</li>
 	<li>Class discussion about the experiences, technologies, genres, authors, and periods students want to experience for the next assignment.</li>
 	<li>Guided exploration of WonderCat, WorldCat, and other non-proprietary discovery tools.</li>
 	<li>Before the end of class, students open their devices and complete a discussion reflection to post on our course website (setting it to private or sharing with classmates).</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is an openly licensed publication that I intend to revise again; I suspect my ideas will change as I engage with my students and colleagues who use these methods in the classroom. I offer this conclusion (of sorts) to share where I am now in my thinking (thanks to the anonymous reviewer who suggested adding this!).

These strategies are helping me grow as a teacher. The second I let my students choose what they would read, I started realizing what I could put in place to encourage engagement with the texts I used to require. I also was able to honestly assess why I had been requiring them. I understand more fully now that I want students to encounter our shared literary history. I want them to experience wonder and confusion and skepticism and curiosity. And I want to help them do something with the energy that emerges from those experiences. I have been encouraged to find that students are eager to engage with challenging and unfamiliar texts when their own interests and concerns guide their exploration.

The peer-review process for this book pushed me to engage with larger debates in our discipline. Revising this book has prompted me to return to my research on the rise of the professional, work I began with a dissertation on amateur performance in the nineteenth century. The amateur productions I reconstructed reveal fascinating conflicts between amateurs, eager to perform with little to no training, and theater professionals who were often insulted by amateurs' lack of respect for training and expertise. I have realized that I am now focusing on this same tension as it relates to literary study, with an important difference: instead of describing conflicts from the past, I am advocating for a different approach to the amateur professional divide today. The assignments in this book are my effort to connect with the many millions of readers outside the academy, starting with the students who won't read what I assign. In the scholarly dismissal of BookTok, fanfiction, and other amateur engagements with literature, we can find evidence of professionals threatened by amateur readers. This is beautifully illustrated in the tenth episode of Matt Seybold’s popular series “Criticism LTD” from the American Vandal podcast: <a href="https://theamericanvandal.substack.com/p/transcript-booktube-booktok-wattpad">“BookTube, BookTok, Wattpad, &amp; The Audible Creation Exchange.”</a> The defensive postures evident and addressed in this episode are understandable but, I think, unnecessary. Amateur enthusiasm for literature outside our most prized authors and genres does not diminish the value of our expertise. It makes it more relevant. Instead of telling students that there’s better literature out there, we can help them discover what their favorite games, songs, and films have in common with stories from the past. I think we can also start claiming professional contributions that extend beyond literary criticism. Because I teach undergraduates, I focus on the research I can do in collaboration with students in my courses (even those not majoring in English). This research can help us better understand how literature works in the world.

One reviewer suggested I read John Guillory’s <em>On Close Reading</em> (2025) and I did. I noticed that, in recounting the history of the technique of close reading and arguing for its enduring importance to our discipline, Guillory did not linger on issues of pedagogy (Scott Newstok's bibliography at the end of the book points to many who have). Guillory’s book helped me articulate my primary complaint with interpretive arguments in required literature courses: these assignments very rarely encourage real engagement with the task of reading. More often, they prompt a performance of knowingness. I am certainly not the first to point to this as the reason so many students cheat on these assignments. I have a greater respect for close reading and its position in the history of our discipline after reading Guillory’s book, but his book has also reinforced my decision not to ask students to perform them in my courses. That said, I think the task of narrating one’s experience with a work of literature and then classifying the experiences and the narrative technologies prompting those experiences is a logical first step in preparing for such a performance. That is, if a student genuinely wants to share their reading with me or others.

I agree wholeheartedly with Guillory’s assertion that “we might see close reading today as the disciplinary analogue of the countercultural movement embracing ‘slow tech’ and other slow forms of cultural consumption” (83). I want students to slow down and really read. By setting aside the performance of knowingness, I think the assignments in this book more effectively encourage this slowing down. These assignments also turn the attention back to how the text works, a task that I think is best accomplished when one sets aside the goal of demonstrating cleverness and originality.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This course focuses on the literature of the long nineteenth century. So, for the majority of the semester, you’ll be choosing texts that were published between the years 1789 and 1914. But we’re not doing that quite yet. As we get started, you’re going to select a story you've already experienced--one that prompted a memorable experience. We know that this can seem a bit daunting. Maybe you’re not in the habit of reading these days or maybe you don’t think the stories you consume are worth mentioning in a “literature” class. Trust us, this process will work with any story (a novel, film, album, videogame, etc). This is because all stories (from Star Wars to Beowulf and from Hamlet to Bridgerton) are fundamentally tools that do work on our brains. These tools are crafted by artisans (authors, content creators, stand-up comics, songwriters, video game developers) who draw on an ever-expanding set of techniques as they create. Literature scholars like to argue about which stories are superior (this is why we have a literary canon), but if it has a character doing something, it’s a story.

In other words, be honest about what you like! Your semester will be most enjoyable if you use this first assignment to explore what you genuinely enjoy. We hope to show you that there are many other stories that have provoked similar experiences in others. If it’s hard to pick just one story, you can go through this process for two or three different stories. The more you explore in this assignment, the more you’ll discover about your preferences.

Once you’ve decided on the story (or stories) that you’ll explore in this assignment, make sure you have access to it. It’s often been the case that students don’t have a copy of the book they read five years ago or don’t have the right console to play a specific video game on campus. Talk to your professor and your library if this is the case. Within the two weeks you’ll spend on this assignment, there should be time to track it down. You can also change your choice if it turns out you can’t access the story. You will need to be able to quote from it to meet the requirements of this assignment.

Our goal is to isolate specific story experiences and then try to figure out which specific features of the story prompted those experiences. Once we’ve isolated the features of the story, we’ll try to figure out the technique the author used to create those features. We’ll do this step by step and you’ll submit a piece of writing that shows your thought process. This means that you are not (for this or any assignment this semester) going to be asked to produce a traditional “English paper” (clear thesis statement supported with evidence from the text). Instead, you are going to describe, explore, and chronicle your process figuring out how you think the story works. You might feel an urge to find out if others have already figured it out and it’s fine to do this (though definitely not required). If you find a resource that offers an explanation, make sure to cite it! You may not figure everything out, and that’s okay.
<h1>Describe your Experience</h1>
Describe how you came to experience the story you’ve chosen and what you remember about the experience. Try to remember the year or even the specific time of year (this will be helpful after you’ve turned the assignment in). Most importantly, try to put into words the emotions you experienced.
<h1>Classify your Experience</h1>
Now that you've described your experience, think about whether that experience is something others have felt. This might be a little challenging because it's not how we typically talk about literature. People interpret literature in all sorts of different ways--that was something I loved the most about it when I was a college student. But you're not thinking about whether someone reached a similar interpretation as you. You're trying to decide if others have had a similar experience. You can see in the list of experiences below that it's quite separate from your interpretation. What we're doing here is using a scientific method similar to what naturalists use when they work from observation in the field to taxonomic classification. If they encounter something that hasn't already been classified, they give it a name and call it a new species (after conferring with other scientists, of course). In the list of experiences below, you might find one that captures the experience you had. If your experience isn't there, you get to name it and, if you want, add it into our list of experiences.
<ul>
 	<li>I felt a sense of wonder (15)</li>
 	<li>I got lost in the story and forgot about my own problems (p. 17)</li>
 	<li>I felt less alone in my trauma</li>
 	<li>I felt courageous (like I would do something even if I was afraid) (34-35)</li>
 	<li>I felt like I was part of a larger community</li>
 	<li>I felt love or emotional connection</li>
 	<li>I felt forgiveness</li>
</ul>
<h1>Describe the features prompting your experience</h1>
Here’s where it becomes important to have access to the story as you do this assignment. Return to the story and try to determine what exactly it was about the story that shaped your experience. Was it some aspect of the plot? Was it the way the narrator told the story? Was it a surprising character? Was it some aspect of the world the author created? It might be a combination of features so include everything! If it’s specific language from the story, include direct quotation in this section. If it is something that can’t be quoted (some aspect of the plot or some feel of the storyworld), put it into your own words with as much detail as possible.

Example of direction quotation:

Example of paraphrase:
<h1>Theorize about/Try to determine the technique that created the feature</h1>
Now that you have figured out which features of the story prompted your experience, try to imagine the technique the author used to create that feature. We say imagine because that’s exactly how this sort of analysis works. You probably can’t know exactly what the author(s) did or why they did it (even if they explain it in an interview!) so the trick is to wrap your head around the fact that this thing you experienced was created deliberately by someone (or, more likely, a team of people). These people created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters. There might have been discussions (even arguments) between authors and editors, screenwriters and directors, or game designers and graphics editors. What set of decisions do you think prompted your emotional response and who is most likely responsible for it? [Mike should check out the director of photography on that film]

<strong><em>Each Story-Experience-Feature-Technique linkage is one unit. This assignment requires you to identify at least one unit, but you can repeat this process for however many distinct experiences you had with a story. You can also repeat this process for however many stories you want to explore.</em></strong>

[pull in full list here or link to the list in the glossary?]

The stretch: taking a regular pattern of plot or character or storyworld or narrative style and extending the pattern further.

<strong>Plot</strong>
plot twist
hurt delay (storyteller constructs a way for trauma to strike a character without the character realizing it…audience knows the trauma before it is felt by the character) (18-22)

<strong>Narrator</strong>
metaphor
human God voice (a narrator who did what a sung paean did: give our brain the feeling of joining a holy chorus that sensed danger nearby) (37)
the Almighty Heart (39)
Intimate disclosure + Wonder (54) [any lyric voice that lays baare a private feeling…any he-she-they story that make makes a personal disclosure about its characters]

<strong>Storyworld</strong>

<strong>Character</strong>
heroic character
<h1>Discuss your choices</h1>
Before submitting your final draft, we will take time in class to discuss what you've discovered. In class, I'll ask you to share the following information from your draft post in our shared Word Online document. We'll focus especially on any new experiences and techniques you might have discovered in your process.
<ul>
 	<li>Literary Work you're writing about</li>
 	<li>Experiences you had while reading (up to three)</li>
 	<li>For each experience, which of the following elements of narrative do you think caused the experience?</li>
 	<li>What technique do you think the creator used to prompt that experience?</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your task with this assignment is to serve as a tour guide for a student who chooses to read the text you choose for this unit. When you’re reading a text written before you were born, it can sometimes seem that you’re in a strange land filled with unfamiliar rules and languages. You will position yourself as a tour guide for the student who wants a little help as they navigate this experience. I say you’ll be a tour guide, but you’ll actually be an editor. You will compose an introductory note to help these future students prepare for their journey into the unfamiliar, and include notes at moments in the text where you think you would have benefited from an explanation or context. You might consider sharing, in your introductory note, what a person in the storyworld of your chosen text can do that can’t be done in our world (or what can’t be done in that world that can be done in our world). I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to make this project public to get full credit for the assignment.

Create a post detailing your experience of the text you've chosen and then share the link to your annotations. You'll share 1-3 distinct experiences you had while reading, specific passages illustrating the experiences, and your assessment of the literary techniques that prompted the experience. You can choose to share your post with classmates or share it only with me.
<ul>
 	<li>You don't need to finish this text to create notes for it. You'll have an option to finish the text by the end of the semester and refine your tour guide edition at the end of the semester.</li>
 	<li><strong>You can complete this assignment using Hypothesis (I’ll help you create a free account and annotate an existing version of the text from Internet Archive). If you’ve only ever used Hypothesis inside Canvas, you will need to create a free account for the public tool following the instructions here (I will provide guidance in class as you do this): <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://web.hypothes.is/start/</a></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>I will ask you to draft and revise your annotations in a private group named for your edition. This will allow you to share your introduction and notes with me (not all public Hypothesis users). We’ll walk through this in class, but here is guidance on creating a private group: <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-create-a-private-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-create-a-private-group/</a> </strong></li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're going to start by focusing on plot. I want you to share your experience reading any written text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before. Think of your post as an account of your journey exploring this literary work (or a summary of your findings). There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with your classmates.

With this prompt, I'm sharing the things I want you to include in your post. You can create three distinct sections with headings, or you can organize things differently if you see a better structure.

<strong>Featured Image</strong>

Your featured image can represent the content of your post in a wide range of ways. The image can be a book cover, an image of a page, or fan art inspired by one of the works you’re writing about. You might also want to create something new to use as your featured image. Make sure that you include complete media file details for your featured image (“caption” and “alternative text” fields). Please also include the URL for the image file in the “description” field.

<strong>Reading Experience</strong>

Describe your experience reading (or listening to an audio recording of) any written text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before (we'll go over strategies for searching). This should be something brand new to you, so you can begin by sharing how you selected it and any expectations you brought with you. Focus on capturing your experience reading with as much detail as possible. Include specific passages that prompted an emotional response from you, even if the emotion is confusion  or frustration  because things don’t make sense to you. You may find yourself looking for context as you read so you can understand unfamiliar words and make sense of a storyworld that is not familiar; describe the sources you reference (Wikipedia articles, dictionary definitions, blog posts, scholarly sources, etc.) and if/how they are helpful. Reading a text written before you were born can be challenging!    In class, we will go over strategies for working through difficulty. [your goal is to share 1-3 distinct experiences you had while reading this text, provide quotation or paraphrase illustrating the experiences, and your best guess at the literary techniques that prompted that experience].

<strong>Plot Summary</strong>

Almost every Wikipedia article about a work of literature has a section with the heading of “Plot Summary.” As we’ve discussed, reading a plot summary can never replace the experience of actually reading a text because it is meant only to convey a summary of the plot, not the full complexity of the text. That said, summarizing a plot is very challenging, as is clear from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary">the guidance Wikipedia editors have written on the task</a>.

Check if a Wikipedia article exists about the text you’ve read. If it does, paste the plot summary into your post with a clear citation.

Below it, create your own summary from scratch or paste the same summary and make changes so that it is as clear and objective as possible. Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary">guidance from Wikipedia editors</a> as you do this work.

<strong>Adapting the Plot</strong>

Take your new or revised plot summary and adapt it, changing some aspect of the plot   that you have experienced up to that point. This can be fascinating to read once you’ve finished the work (and there will be an option to do this at the end of the semester). If you’ve only read the first part of a story, you’ll only be changing things that happen in the first part of the story. Approach this as a thought experiment. Your task is not necessarily to improve the text (especially if you haven’t experienced it fully yet), but to think about the decisions an author has made about the plot. After making your changes to the plot, write about your reasons for making those changes and the impact you think this change will make to the overall text and its impact on readers. If you feel inspired to write new sections of the story for your adaptation, please do, but you only really need to describe an altered plot—not actually create it.

<strong>A complete post should have the following components:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Title</li>
 	<li>Featured Image (something you’ve created or something you’ve found</li>
 	<li>Complete media file details for featured image (“caption” and “alternative text”)</li>
 	<li>Captions conveying attribution statements for all images in the post</li>
 	<li>Actual post with source material clearly cited with hyperlinks (flyby hyperlinks and actual citations)</li>
 	<li>A detailed account of your experience reading a text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before</li>
 	<li>A plot summary from Wikipedia (if available) and your revision to that plot summary (bold your revisions)</li>
 	<li>Your adaptation of the plot and commentary on what the changes would do (bold your adaptations)</li>
 	<li>A list of works cited at the bottom of your post formatted according to MLA guidelines.</li>
 	<li>Attribution statement for featured image below the list of Works Cited.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Reminders</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>You may find it useful to compose in a document outside of OpenLab (Microsoft Word, a Google Doc, or something else).</li>
 	<li>Assume that there will be spoilers—no need to alert readers to them.</li>
 	<li>We’re not writing reviews, though people reading what we’re writing might decide to check something out that they might not have encountered otherwise.</li>
 	<li>Include lots of images and videos (even when writing about a text). Do your best to break up the wall of text.</li>
 	<li>Include lots of direct quotation. If you’re saying that a text has a specific feature, make sure to give an example of that feature</li>
 	<li>Write to a general audience—clarity is a priority!!</li>
 	<li>Share your experience of the text! Give details.</li>
 	<li>Share your best sense of how the writer prompted an emotional response you had. If you want to research how others have explained the writer’s technique, go for it. Do make sure to cite what you read.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You’ve written four posts this semester, each one focusing on one of the core elements of narrative. We looked closely at narrators, storyworlds, characters, and plots. Throughout this experience, I have encouraged you to capture and share your responses to literary works that you are experiencing for the first time. As we conclude the semester, I want to give you an opportunity to revisit the literature you’ve read (perhaps finishing texts you didn’t have time to finish earlier in the semester) and expand on the discoveries you made through the the first four assignments.

Since the start of the semester, our course website has been set to private, meaning that only the students enrolled in the course can see the site. You have chosen between publishing your work (making it visible to your classmates) or keeping it private (so only I can see it). At the end of the semester, I will make our entire website public and you can choose to have your posts included in that public site (visible to anyone who finds our website) or set to private (still only visible to me). You also have the option of setting a password for any posts that you want to be able to share with family and friends only.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Possibilities</h2>
Select one of the following options for the final project!
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Revise three of your posts for publication on our course website</h4>
Revise three or more of your posts for inclusion in our course website, which I will make fully public at the end of the semester. If you choose this option, you will finish the literary work(s) you wrote about in your posts and make sure to include direct quotation or clips to illustrate the specific features you discuss. You will also need to pay careful attention to attribution statements for images and other content created by other people. <strong>I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to publish any of these posts to receive full credit on this assignment.</strong>

<strong>Please leave your original posts as they are, but copy all of the content into new posts to revise them further</strong>

Check out this <a href="https://prezi.com/p/w_-nwr-ersn0/citations-and-attribution-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presentation demonstrating how to think about citations and attribution statements</a>: both very important when making your work public!

When you incorporate an image alongside the text of your project, you should include a caption below the image that includes an attribution statement. To craft an attribution statement, follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidance at this Creative Commons article</a>. If you use the image in a context where captions are not possible (if it is included as a featured image that doesn’t display a caption), include the attribution statement under an “Attribution Statement” heading at the bottom of your page. Note that you can include copyrighted images if you are offering commentary on that image in your post because of <a href="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/2-4-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright/">the fair use limitation on copyright</a>. You still need to include an attribution statement making it clear who holds the copyright (I typically add “all rights reserved” after the name of the copyright holder).

I will want to see at least one completely revised post when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback. More is better!
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Revise a plot summary on Wikipedia</h4>
This option involves expanding on the work you started with assignment four to actually make changes to the plot summary of an article on Wikipedia. If you select this option, you will read the entirety of the text you selected for assignment four (or the entirety of some other text published between 1800 and 1940 that you read for the first time this semester), plan revisions that will make the plot summary more accurately meet the guidelines provided for Wikipedia editors, and then complete a few Wiki Education trainings (listed below) to prepare to make the changes to the actual article on Wikipedia. Your work on this project will be public. I will help you create a Wikipedia account (Wikipedia has an IP block on our campus, which I can explain more in person). The Wikipedia username you select and the changes you make to the article will be visible to anyone who wants to view them (even if another editor changes your edits, your revision will be in the article’s history).

</ul>
I will want to see a draft of your revisions to the plot summary when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback.
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Be a Tour Guide for a Text from the Past</h4>
This option expands on our discussion about storyworld, but takes it in a new direction. Your task with this assignment is to serve as a tour guide for a student who chooses to read a text you’ve read this semester. When you’re reading a text written before you were born, it can sometimes seem that you’re in a strange land filled with unfamiliar rules and languages. You will position yourself as a tour guide for the student who wants a little help as they navigate this experience. I say you’ll be a tour guide, but you’ll actually be an editor. You will compose an introductory note to help these future students prepare for their journey into the unfamiliar, and include notes at moments in the text where you think you would have benefited from an explanation or context. You might consider sharing, in your introductory note, what a person in the storyworld of your chosen text can do that can’t be done in our world (or what can’t be done in that world that can be done in our world). I encourage you to make this work public, but you are not required to make this project public to get full credit for the assignment.
<ul>
 	<li>You need to have finished reading the text you select</li>
 	<li><strong>You can complete this assignment using Hypothesis (I’ll help you create a free account and annotate an existing version of the text–perhaps from Project Gutenberg). If you’ve only ever used Hypothesis inside Canvas, you will need to create a free account for the public tool following the instructions here (I will provide guidance in class as you do this): <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://web.hypothes.is/start/</a></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>I will ask you to draft and revise your annotations in a private group named for your edition. This will allow you to share your introduction and notes with me (not all public Hypothesis users). We’ll walk through this in class, but here is guidance on creating a private group: <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-create-a-private-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-create-a-private-group/</a> </strong></li>
</ul>

I will want to see a draft of your editorial introduction and at least one note when we meet for our individual conference so I can give you feedback.
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Create a Text Exhibit</h4>
In a typical literature paper, a student presents a claim about a text with paragraphs analyzing specific passages from the text and contextual materials to support that claim. This option invites you to present these same components (a claim about a text and specific passages) as an exhibit of three or more items. More specifically, I invite you to curate a “Text Exhibit” for one new text you’ve read this semester (published between 1800 and 1940) to display on the third floor of Harugari Hall. Beyond making decisions about what to include in your exhibit, this option also involves taking care in crafting object labels for the items you include. You will decide how much to guide viewers to see what you see in the images you have selected (and how much to leave interpretation open). This option could easily become an exhibit of interesting context for the text (leaving the text itself behind) and I don’t want that, so the only restriction is that at least two of the three items you include in your exhibit should feature actual text (a photo of a specific passage from your copy of the text, an image of the text as it first appeared in print, or some other representation of the text itself).

<strong>You are not required to install your exhibit in Harugari Hall (though I encourage you to do so!). You can submit a Word document including three images and the object labels for the images as your final project if you wish. </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>I have a collection of thrifted frames you can select from (and there are hundreds more in thrift stores near campus if you want to find your own!)</li>
 	<li>We can print in color up to 11×17 [I will show you how to prepare your image for printing using Canva]</li>
 	<li>Your primary writing for this assignment will be for the object labels to accompany each item in the exhibit. To help you prepare to write in this potentially unfamiliar genre, please review <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VA_Gallery-Text-Writing-Guidelines_online_Web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the guidance prepared by the Victoria and Albert Museum</a>.</li>
</ul>
I will want to see a draft of your object labels during our individual conference so I can give feedback.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking ahead to the “Final Exam”</h2>
The final exam activity will involve sharing final projects. I will also set aside at least thirty minutes during the final exam period for each of you to compose a <strong>statement of practice</strong>, which will describe specific things you have learned in this course and how those things will inform your behavior in the future. This might be related to a future career or it might be related to your non-work life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Day by Day

Day 1:
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss assignment prompt (read in advance, ideally annotated with student questions)</li>
 	<li>Discuss example post (also read in advance, with students encouraged to explore citations and bring passages for discussion)</li>
 	<li>Conclude with guidance on hunting for a text. Students share things they’re interested in (places, events, genres, issues, literary techniques) and the class makes recommendations</li>
</ul>
Day 2: Discuss first impressions of chosen text and build strategies for working through difficulty

Day 3: Discuss reading experience section of post (due before class)

Day 4: Discuss draft character (due before class)

&nbsp;

Prompt for Character Assignment

For this third assignment, I want you to share your experience encountering a new character through written text. Think of your post as an account of your journey exploring this literary work (or a summary of your findings). There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with your classmates.

Create a character...focus on autobiography

Put a person you know really well in another storyworld

Unique thing about this character you’ve never seen in another person

One episode in this character’s life that would help someone understand the character

What character from another work of literature would really get along with this character

<strong>Featured Image</strong>

Your featured image can represent the content of your post in a wide range of ways. The image can be a book cover, an image of a page, or fan art inspired by one of the works you’re writing about. If you include a play or film script, perhaps an image from the production or the movie poster. You might also want to create something new to use as your featured image. Make sure that you include complete media file details for your featured image (“caption” and “alternative text” fields). Please also include the URL for the image file in the “description” field.

&nbsp;

<strong>Experiencing Character</strong>

Describe your experience reading (or listening to an audio recording of) of character in any written text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before (we'll go over strategies for searching). This should be something brand new to you, which means that you will very likely by looking for context as you read so you can understand unfamiliar words and makes sense of a storyworld that is not familiar. Focus on describing your experience reading with as much detail as possible. Incorporate specific passages that prompted a response from you, whether that response is related to enjoyment of the text or frustration about being confused by the text. Make sure to keep track of all of the sources you reference as you read (Wikipedia articles, dictionary definitions, article on the Internet, blog posts, scholarly sources, etc.). Reading a text written before you were born can be challenging! We will go over strategies that can help you make sense of the unfamiliar.

<strong>Create a Character</strong>

You can include both your thought process as you try to create this character (ideas you considered but discarded even), but make sure to try to actually write a section of a totally new story that includes the character you have created.]]></content:encoded>

This page gathers the responses received from reviewers who gave us permission to publish their feedback. It is organized according to the open-ended questions we asked reviewers to address. Where these responses have prompted significant revisions to the book I've gestured toward those revisions with footnotes.

</div>
&nbsp;
<h2>Please comment on the clarity of language in the text. Given the audience, we are looking for lucid, accessible prose that provides adequate context for any jargon/technical terminology used.</h2>
<em>Not only is the book clear for fellow educators, the assignments are very clear for students. The idea of education here could have a wider audience than higher education teachers. Perhaps this could be extended to high school teachers who are working with disengaged passenger students. The idea of cultivating wonder and autonomy could also be attractive to alternative forms of education like the unschooling and deschooling movements. </em><strong> -Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>The language used throughout was clear and would be clear to students. The one exception is in the glossaries/lists of technologies. This is understandable given that these are the terms students will need to learn to assess and categorize the narratives they have read. But I had some trouble recognizing or understanding some of them from their descriptions, so I don't know that students would understand them. They seemed to prioritize interesting names rather than names or descriptions that would be more readily understandable to first- or second-year gen-ed students. I don't know if many students at my urban commuter public college will know what bank tubes are! </em><strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong>

<em>Searching for Wonder is a book that is easy to skim—due to the straightforward, clear prose. Isbell’s engaging voice makes this book also a joy to read slowly and recurringly. The author shows enthusiasm, curiosity, humor, tenacity, and, of course, wonder in every word.</em>

<em>The student-facing language of the assignments and introductory guided imagery is carefully crafted to be welcoming, kind, and open. Borrowing language from other instructors is always something I’m wary of since, in this era of the LMS and hybrid and fully online courses, much of our teaching personas comes across through written text we’ve published online. My desired persona aligns closely with Isbell’s, so I’d feel comfortable using her text (with attribution of course) without it clashing with my other content. Although Isbell offers her resources to use in full, I imagine that many will want to either adjust the phrasing for their own teaching personas or, perhaps, utilize “Dr. Isbell” or “Station Master” as a guide. </em><strong>-Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

<em>The text is accessibly- and engagingly-written.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>The language here is clear, especially for anyone who teaches literature at a university level and teaches not just in their specialities but also in general education courses. That said, some further definitions of the terms adopted from Angus Fletcher's Wonderworks could be helpful. The terms I'm thinking of are "narrative technologies" and "story experiences"; it is not that these terms are foreign, but rather that I think it would be helpful to have a description of how they are being used specifically in this context. This description could perhaps come from more insight into how Isbell explains these concepts to students.</em> <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>
<h2>Please comment on this text’s potential usefulness in your literature courses. Based on your experience, what could the strategies, assignments, examples, and glossaries in this book make possible in literature courses?</h2>
<em>My upcoming religion and literature course is already set as an exploration of the Catholic literary revival, so I have a limited canon related to the values of my institution. At the same time, I will be able to better engage students with the readings through adopting strategies outlined in this book. The assignments that promote experiential readings of literature with a glossary that enables to speak about their reading with both authenticity and a shared lexicon will improve my commonplace book assignments where they share texts that most affected them. Likewise the presentation of literature as technology will meld perfectly with our discussion of virtuous uses of technology (especially AI). As an educator, I have to reflect more on this because I teach Tools for Conviviality in this course, especially the idea that we should not be shaped by tools, but at the same time, I present literature as a shared experience that shapes us. If literature is a tool, and human dignity resists being shaped by a tool, then I am grateful for the way this books calls me to think more deeply on the relationship between the techne of the writer's craft and the techne of modern technology.</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>Literature courses at my college are mostly gen-ed offerings, with a few meeting requirements for specific majors, and some minors including a range of literature course offerings in the requirements. So an approach that doesn't emphasize coverage of literature would work for all or most literature courses we offer.</em>
<em>As the book proposes an approach that asks students to observe, detail, and describe, categorize, and reflect on their experiences with narrative and provides tools to do so. These are important techniques for students in any of the majors our college offers, from health fields to engineering, design, and business, etc.</em>
<em>The approach presented in the book also emphasizes the experiences and skills students bring into the course and integrates it into collaborative co-creation of knowledge with each other and the instructor.</em>
<em>The course de-emphasizes grades, focusing on student learning rather than evaluation. It would be useful to understand both the affordances of this approach and what difficulties that creates. Do students all finish with the same A grade? What keeps them from an A if not? What does it mean to give 100% for an assignment if a student didn't do all parts, or didn't get things right? And if those projects don't get 100%, what do they get instead?[footnote]Great questions. I'm addressing this in the "strategies" chapter under "Be a human teacher."[/footnote]</em>
<em>A course schedule would be helpful to understand pacing. This could also include what happens during class time for each of the classes during a project.[footnote]Yes, excellent idea. Adding this.[/footnote]</em>
<em>Revision is one of the expectations of writing-intensive courses, so it's great that the projects include a revision step. That said, I didn't understand what work students were supposed to do in the revision, nor why it was supposed to be done in a google doc rather than in a post or the initial post. A bit more explanation in the "How Does This Work?" section would help instructors considering adopting the approach--putting greater explanation in the assignments themselves could benefit instructors and students.</em> <strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong>

<em>This book is both highly specific—I feel as if I could replicate this exactly in my own class with very little alteration—and deeply flexible. I find myself thinking of ways to adapt Isbell’s concepts and tools for similar applications. Although I do teach literature in some of my courses (as well as film and theatrical performance, which have their own set of similar technologies), I more often teach non-fiction essays. When I teach essays, I draw comparisons between their techniques and those of short stories, films, or other fictional pieces. For example, I ask: How do authors turn the scholars they cite into characters within their essays? How do authors take readers on a journey? Do they set up some exposition before setting off an inciting argument? Do they begin in media res without any explanation to hook readers? I guide students through this process while we all read the same essays, but typically I find myself hoping that they’ll do the same with essays that they encounter on their own, for pleasure (Oh, I hope they read essays for pleasure!) or for citation. Searching for Wonder provides me with a potential framework for guiding my students through a process of reading essays of their choosing and working through and sharing their experiences of reading, classifying, and identifying the technologies used by the authors. This process provides students with agency, the ability to help other students, and also allows us as instructors more opportunities for assessment.</em> -<strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

<em>I think this approach would be particularly useful for me in the creative writing classroom, where I find the most students who don't necessarily complete the reading. I often teach literature in the creative writing classroom, so Isbell's approach could help me show the applicability of closely engaging with literature to improving as a creative writer.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>This text will be highly useful for my literature courses. I am especially taken by the way that this text faces, head on, the problem of students' not reading and balances that disheartening recognition with an energy to help students discover the joys of reading by tapping into (and guiding them to discover) the emotions and experiences that they already enjoy. I love this move--that asks students to reflect on their experiences with texts--not just because it seems a perfect way to reading, but also because it gifts the professor insight into their students personally. I have become an even firmer believer in the necessity of learning about my students on an individual level, and Isbell's work integrates that goal into the courses' goals with aplomb. One of the best examples of this arises for me in the first assignment that asks students to reflect carefully on one of their favorite texts. This assignment also, at least implicitly, targets another central goal of mine: stressing to students the personal and contemporary relevance of the texts with which we engage.</em>
<em>Considering further assignments: on reading the "plot summary" assignment, I wanted to rush into any classroom and try it out. This assignment gets students to think about why and how a story works--a goal in all my classes--and does it on so many different levels or through different modes that, I think, would both engage students and challenge them.</em>
<em>The glossaries of both narrative technologies and story experiences would be something I would quickly integrate in class too, if only to help students and myself come to a shared language by which to speak of the texts we explore. That shared language is another "thing" that I see this text making possible in literature courses in which it's often difficult to get students all to the "same page." Importantly, this is not to say that students would feel restricted by this language or the glossaries. One of the advantages I see of these glossaries is that ALL are invited to add to it and that power/possibility alone would generate productive class discussion.</em> <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>
<h2>Please comment on the appropriateness of this text for the curriculum at your institution. How thoroughly do you think you can accomplish the goals and learning outcomes of the literature courses you teach with the strategies and assignments included in this book? Is there something that could be added to address any gaps you anticipate?</h2>
<em>Since I teach at a small religious university where the liberal arts are practically non-existent but we still try to remain in the tradition of liberal education, I resonate with the author's work to make literature accessible for non-majors. This would work well for our first-year</em>
<em>experience courses that focus on literature and could possibly be adapted for our medical humanities program. Since we have a character education initiative, there are ways that the ideas here could work very well for us. The emphasis on autonomy (an intellectual virtue in the Jubilee Centre framework), goal-setting (necessary for students to grow into the kind of persons they want to be rather than just skill acquisition), the role of the teacher as a model (virtue is caught), and the turn toward drawing out love for the practice of reading by that model (love is the motivating virtue after all) all fit very well in our educational culture. At the same time, there are ways that there would be a tension with our curriculum, which could tease out interested aspects about this approach. In cases when education is seen as a way to point to what is worthy of our attention, then what do we lose if we stop pointing to specific literary artifacts? If education is inherently relational, then do we risk atomizing our work further by having students fully select their own texts? I mean these questions as someone who is very open to this project and grateful for the way it allows us to think through more what it means to teach literature.</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>It's great that students can study their experiences with narrative and map those onto narrative technologies. I like the flexibility to incorporate non-written narratives. But I don't know that a course called literature but in which someone could read no literature would work at my college. I thought the courses that asked students to read different types of narratives for different assignments could mean that students could be ensured to experience different formats of narratives.</em>
<em>There is a useful emphasis on students directing their choices, and mention of the difficulty of making choices sometimes, but no clear solution for overcoming the obstacle when it threatens to slow a student down to the point of not progressing, which I find relatively often when students face a choice rather than being told what to work on. Since there is nothing to get started without a text, I would need to have a way to move students into making a choice so they don't fall behind from the start.[footnote]The goal of WonderCat is to help those who struggle to make a choice, and I would recommend any instructor going into teaching with this method create their own WonderCat account in advance and enter their own experiences with literature they'd ideally like students to encounter. I'm adding this to the "strategies" section of the book.[/footnote]</em>
<em>I don't have a clear sense of how much writing students will produce for the four posts and the final project/revision. I would need to be specific about that to meet the requirements for a writing-intensive course, which all of our literature courses are.</em>
<em>The book addresses the situation of students not finishing the readings they begin, but it doesn't make reference to how much reading to expect of students or that students should expect of themselves, or what taking on too much or too little reading can do to the outcome of the projects.</em>
<em>These variables--which texts, how much to write, and how much to read (or consume)--leave so much choice for students that they might not know if they're on the right track, or how much more they need to do. When assignments offer the option for reading one narrative or more, I don't know what would motivate a student to choose three instead of one without them understanding what having more data offers them (like in the example of categorizing like biologists do).[footnote]I'm revising this prompt to reduce it to just one story. After teaching with it this past semester, I didn't have any students opt to write about more than one so I think it was very much a "too much choice" situation.[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong>

<em>I could use or adapt the assignments in this text for any of the courses I teach in our English Department. I don’t see the need for this text to address every learning outcome for every course. One of the Learning Goals in our department is to “sustain a life-long engagement with and delight in literature, art, and culture.” I don’t think I’ve encountered a course design before Isbell’s that prioritizes delight above all else. If we can teach students how to approach texts with wonder and delight, perhaps we can better help our students meet our other learning goals.</em> -<strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

<em>Since the literature curriculum at my institution is very based in transmitting a shared knowledge of canonical works in a long literary tradition, I don't think this approach would apply as well there.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>At this point, there is still freedom for professors at my institution in terms of accomplishing courses' goals and learning outcomes. In short, we still are designing our courses, assignments, reading lists. So simply in terms of the freedom of texts encouraged here, this text would be appropriate for my use.</em>

<em>I do believe that this text will need to be more explicit about how a professor can use WONDERCAT to direct students to texts in the specific time period, genre, issue, etc. that would be the focus of the course. I see that step as something Isbell has navigated well already considering especially the Nineteenth-Century Literature and Representations of Nature courses. I don't however see that yet explained in this text.[footnote]Yes, excellent point. This summer (2025), we are refining the featuers of WonderCat that will allow users to filter everything in the database by publication date and country of origin. I've expanded "WonderCat, a Discovery Tool" to explain how to make the most of the tool.[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>
<h2>Please comment on the approach to literature with examples, if possible. Please comment on any theoretical approaches to literature contradicted by the way literature is framed in this text.</h2>
<em>As an educator and a deschooler in the tradition of Ivan Illich, dedicated to promoting autonomy and respecting the student's ability to grow to maturity in a field, I am very attracted to this way of opening up literature to student choice. I see also where it can be an essential strategy for changing institutions.</em>
<em>At the same time, I have two concerns about this approach that if addressed could help potential adopters. 1) I am not sure if literature should be reduced to experience with a focus on emotional experience. I think the way this method unpacks that important aspect of literature is compelling, but I want my students to have something more. I want them to see that literature is a form of shared reasoning through story. I have a relational view of literature and technology that I would like to see in an approach to literature. I see where this method accomplished that by emphasizing discussion of shared techniques, but I'm curious how this technique could interface with other views of literature. 2) I am convinced by Gert Biesta that the primary function of teaching is to point at what's worthy of our attention, and to attend to it together with students. I can see where this class method does that so well by facilitating discussions with various student-selected texts, but I would like to see more discussion of what we might lose without assigning texts or how the curation through WonderCat offers another way to attend together as a learning community.[footnote]Absolutely. I have heard this from many colleagues and have addressed it more fully in "Strategies"[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>As I read this book, I thought about how I would spend class time with students, and what they would need from me to make this approach work. I think students would need to learn about the different narrative technologies. They might know many--and if they did, they might want to start a list early that they add to all semester. But there are many they don't know, and I don't know how they would complete the assignments without learning what the different technologies are. Is there time devoted to perusing the glossaries or WonderCat?[footnote]Yes, the need for this emerged during the Spring 2025 semester and I've mentioned it on the "typical class" page.[/footnote] Although students can identify experiences using whatever descriptive language they can find, and can then revise based on consensus among the class about how to describe their experiences, I don't know that the same works for narrative technologies. I might want to ask students to read something that explains, say, elements of fiction, or that describes, for example, order, duration, and frequency. Asking students to read about reading literature seems a useful addition, supporting their efforts to understand the metacognitive moves we make when experiencing narratives.</em>

<em>I also wonder if short examples could be shared during class time to have some shared experiences that would motivate the terminology they need to develop and revise throughout the semester.</em> <strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong>

<em>This is a user-centered approach to teaching literature. The focus is on students’ choices, identifications, and experiences. This aligns with the author’s purpose in developing this curriculum, which is, crucially, to get students to read. Isbell convincingly argues that learning and wonder cannot occur until students take the indispensable step of reading.</em>
<em>As Isbell notes, students are used to being asked to interpret texts. This book foregrounds, instead, embodied experiences of reading. It asks students to reflect not just on what they thought or felt about a text, but on what drew them to it. What were they doing while reading? Where was their body in space? Reading Isbell’s example posts demonstrates an entire physical, mental, and individual experience, one that’s framed as meaningful to others, especially through the sharing of blog posts and commenting.</em>
<em>Blog posts remain a format that privileges long-form writing. Isbell states adamantly that they are not English essays—and they clearly aren’t—but are they reflections? Blog posts? Content? I can’t help but feel that categorizing these responses could be important to the mission of the book.[footnote]I think you're right! I struggled with this at first, and so far I think my answer is that they are narratives of the student's reading experience (but narratives can take many shapes).[/footnote] The courses may not be so meta as to ask students to assign or ascribe technologies to their own responses, but this kind of attention to genre, purpose, and audience impact seems worth emphasizing. It could encourage a stronger sense of curiosity and wonder as students approach all kinds of texts.</em>
<em>Although the students spend time focusing inwardly on their own experiences, they are also asked to connect their experiences to those of others in Wondercat. By classifying their experiences into existing or new categories, students are building experiential communities that demonstrate the ways that texts work in identifiable and repeatable ways. This reinforces Angus Fletcher’s claims about narrative technologies and the way they work on the human brain.</em>
<em>When reading through the content about the nineteenth-century literature course, I wasn’t sure if the focus stayed entirely on the twenty-first-century experiences of the text or if Isbell or her students were inputting into Wondercat readers’ reactions recorded in nineteenth-century diaries (for example). I wondered if the class discussed how narrative technologies worked across time and in different cultural contexts.[footnote]This is a brilliant idea I had not considered! [/footnote] <strong>-Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</strong></em>

<em>One thing I would wonder about is how this approach might sideline an appreciation of how texts emerge in literary history alongside similar texts. I anticipate that Isbell would propose that that important goal be served in later literature courses attended by only motivated students.[footnote]This is incredibly helpful. I have revised a section of the "strategies" page to address this.[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

I see the approach to literature here as through a "craft" angle. When I focus on the concerns I see as central to a "craft" angle, I explain to my students that we will be looking at how and why a text "works" and what it "does" to us as its audience. That approach to texts is key to my pedagogy; however, also important is introducing students to the sociohistorical context of the texts with which we engage. This text--most notably in its timeline assignments--convinces me that this approach to teaching attends to sociohistorical concerns. I would, however, like to see more explicit discussion of if/how/when such explorations enter class discussions. I am not expecting (or wanting) to see lectures but wondering if/how such concerns arise in the assignments (and if I missed that in my reading--apologies!). <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>
<h2>Please comment on the internal consistency of the text in terms of terminology and framework.</h2>
<em>As a reader, I have not noticed any inconsistencies. The rethinking of literary techniques as technology is fascinating and clear. My suggestion in this way would not be for increased consistency but for more room to be given to the implications of this shift.</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>I appreciated seeing the consistent approach to assignments, including the patterning and repetition of instructions. There is a reference to returning to the first assignment for instructions, rather than including that information again--which would be too long to include in its entirety. However, a link back to it and perhaps a list of the different steps but with no explanation would be useful there.[footnote]Great idea. Done.[/footnote]</em>

<em>I wondered, though, if this level of repetition, which I value for its consistency, would instead mean that students would overlook what was said, that it would be extra and not internalized. If that were the case, would it make more sense to have a document that addresses, for example, revision, or grading, and then each project's instructions would link to that one document about revision, or grading, rather than repeat all of that information each time.</em>

<em>It was not clear to me when to use the glossaries versus WonderCat.</em> <strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong>

<em>The terminology and philosophy of Angus Fletcher’s Wonderworks is clear without the reader having read that text. Isbell takes Fletcher’s work into her own specific direction. The terminology surrounding the narrative technologies and the processes students move through while reading are clear and consistent across the assignments and their explanations.</em> <em>-</em><strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

<em>I think the work is internally consistent in its terminology and framework.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

I saw internal consistency of terms and framework throughout this text. However, sometimes that consistency introduces little errors--that I fear students would catch--in assignments. For instance, in the Algorithms and the Arts course (LOVE the idea behind this course), the assignments for film and music include some errors, specifically references to story/reading terminology, etc.. Also I wonder if the FAQs for those assignments need to be shifted to film or music specific as well.[footnote]Thank you! Corrected.[/footnote] <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>
<h2>Please comment on the organization of this text. A pdf edition will be made available upon launch, but this review is focused on the digital edition. Our goal is for the topics of the text to be presented in a logical, clear fashion.</h2>
<em>The text is readable, and the opening sections set the stage well with the explanation of literary technologies and the detailed explanation of the typical class session followed by assignments offered generously in modular design on Pressbooks, and concluding with a searchable glossary. This organization makes excellent use of the digital structure of writing in Pressbooks. At the same time, as a reader, I found myself wanting a formal conclusion after the example projects and before the appendices with the two glossaries. It might be that I missed the rhetorical moves that accomplish this in the opening sections, but I would like to see something that returns all the generous course information in how this way of teaching changes our view of literature, the classroom, and the profession.</em>[footnote]Great point. I added a "Conclusion, of Sorts"[/footnote] <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>The expandable parts of the later sections were helpful to see the overall subtopics before expanding individual sections. It would be easier to navigate if there were a way to collapse the expanded sections from the bottom. More helpful would be a way to move from one chapter to the next without going back to the top, since when each section is expanded, the page is quite lengthy.</em>
<em>It would be helpful to have additional linking within the text. I mentioned earlier linking to the first project when later projects refer to that project's instructions. Additionally, linking to the glossaries and/or to WonderCat at each mention would be useful.</em>
<em>I would find it helpful to read a brief description of each of these courses in the "How Does This Work?" section, perhaps starting with the course description and then explaining what each does differently. That would mean that I could better understand the rationale for the differences across the four courses. It could also establish an expectation for anyone else modding this book to do something similar for whatever they add to the approach. These could be added to the book in future editions if social annotation were turned on for commenting from anyone adopting the book's approach.</em>

<em>In the section detailing a typical class, it would be useful to know how long a class period is, and how many class sessions there are per semester. Also, if this course has been designed for fully on-site learning in a semester, what considerations or adjustments might someone make when teaching this as a hybrid, online synchronous, online asynchronous, trimester, quarter, summer session, once-per-week, etc. This might be as simple as acknowledging the timing and modality of these examples, and could additionally benefit from a list of suggestions to shift the course into a different timing or modality. I would not expect a different version of any of these courses, but as instructors implement this approach, they might share their experiences teaching in these different situations.[footnote]I love these ideas and will work on folding this in as we get submissions for the next edition. For now, I have added more internal linking.[/footnote]</em>

<em>I love the idea of inviting students to have a shared imaginative experience, but I don't think my students would read "Welcome to the Station"--and I don't know that I wouldn't lose them reading it aloud in class. I might need to shorten it to keep their attention. <strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong></em>

<em>The book was organized logically into meaningful and accessible sections. I found it easy to navigate. -</em><strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

The text is well-organized, though it does seem less like a book that makes an academic argument (as I'm accustomed to encountering) and more like a pedagogy guide that includes useful materials for teachers who find themselves drawn to Isbell's approach. <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>I found this digital edition both exciting and overwhelming. It's exciting to see all the opportunities made possible and seized because of the digital platform. I loved the fact that there is a link to a workshop led by Isbell and Fletcher (and free!!); this sort of offering could make this text even more inviting to any professors who might consider undertaking this approach to teaching. The links out to assignments within the more global discussions of this pedagogical approach were great too. WONDERCAT itself is fascinating--a real invitation into a rabbit hole!! All that said, there is an overwhelming nature to it. I worried at points that I was perhaps missing sections and other times I felt that I was given too much repetition. Rather than picking up on my reference to "repetition" there, however, I would suggest offering a little more explanation of how to use this digital edition. Some of that explanation could simply be a more explicit identification of what all people can find in the text. I know the TOC does that, but something short could be helpful. More importantly, suggestions about how a user (interested in different goals, like just exploring assignments or just looking at terminology, etc.) might most efficiently use the text could be helpful. Beyond such explanation of the text as a whole, I needed more explanation of how to navigate WONDERCAT. <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong></em>
<h2>Please select how likely you are to use some aspect of this book in future literature courses. What do you think about this book overall?</h2>
<em>Extremely Likely; As a reader, I am grateful for the innovative approach to literature in Searching for Wonder. The refreshing way it approaches student disengagement will become increasingly important as we encourage students to love literature and reading. I am especially grateful for how this book has called me to reconsider my own stance toward literature and my students. I now need to think more deeply about what it means to be formed by a book if literary techniques are kinds of technology. My main question is "What do we do after experiencing wonder?" Once we've had that experience alone while reading or together in the flow of a classroom discussion, where do we point students next? The assignments in this book and the public-facing examples of student work begin to answer that question, but I think it's something for all of us who adopt these strategies to consider further.</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>Extremely Likely; The book offers an exciting way to approach teaching literature to students in a way that gives them more agency, strengthening their observation and description skills, while asking them to consider categories of experiences and tools that can connect different narratives and different readers.</em>

<em>The approach, with its emphasis on student interest and de-emphasis on grading, will help motivate student engagement and confidence.</em>

<em>In addition to wanting to try these techniques to collaborate with students on gathering content for WonderCat, I am especially interested in the variety of approaches to the culmination of the semester, which asks students to display their semester-long learning for a larger audience either physically on campus or virtually as an OpenLab installation.</em>

<em>Although I can see the hesitation some instructors would have with the lack of coverage of the literary canon, I can see the value of this approach in gen-ed courses that do not need to include an exhaustive list of texts from a given period or movement.</em> <em><strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong></em>

<em>Extremely Likely; Searching for Wonder is framed as a gift rather than a mandate. It is an answer to a question that many instructors, not just Isbell, have had: How can we get our students to read? This book does not just provide a gimmick, a carrot, a software, or a philosophy, but rather an entire set of materials, tools, and instruction manuals.</em>

<em>The book privileges two concepts of learning that are important to me and that I have been thinking about recently.</em>

<em>The first is play. How can we make learning more like play for our students? For those of us who have always found joy in our educational institutions, each course, each text was an adventure. In this book, Isbell intentionally builds a playful and imaginative framing device around the course to help her students experience the sense of adventure she feels when reading and learning.</em>

<em>The second concept I have been reflecting on appears in Isbell's opening narrative about the train station. She states, “Nobody is in a hurry.” This is what our students need to hear. Learning isn’t about efficiency. Isbell gives her students, who have been conditioned to produce “deliverables,” permission to not finish the book, to slow down, to focus on their experiences and their connections to the experiences of others.</em>

<em>I look forward to using the content in this book as soon as I can. -<strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</strong></em>

<em>Moderately likely; Isbell's book reflects the immense labor and creative work that she has put in to developing a new way of teaching literature to students who don't necessarily do the reading. This book will help undergraduate instructors give students the sense of autonomy and self-motivation that they need to become committed readers.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

Extremely likely; This book is inspiring. It speaks with the voice of an amazing professor who is open, realistic, daring, and genuinely interested in their students. The Preface alone embodies those qualities and thus perfectly invites other professors into Isbell's work. As I explored the class and assignment descriptions, the commitment to students as active and engaged became increasingly apparent. It exudes most from the assignments that give students (and professors, who, in this pedagogical design, get to become students alongside their "official" students) agency to create and expand the discussion of literature. Many of those assignments were designed in ways to engage people beyond the classroom and thereby foster what, I see, as a goal of any professor and/or any academic institution: inspiring curiosity.

This book is also helpful in very practical ways. It offers example upon example of assignments (and/or introductions to assignments and class "philosophies" and goals) that any professor could adapt for themselves (even if they were not ready/willing to yet move away from their assigned reading list). It explicitly invites that adaptation, and while the voice is unique in all of the explanations and assignments, they are composed in a way that I see them as inherently malleable.

As this text is inspired by Angus Fletcher's work (perhaps written in tandem with Fletcher), it could be helpful to have an overview of his work/theories early in the text. There is some discussion there but for those new to it or with just a thumbnail knowledge of it, a little more background could be a helpful foundation. Full disclosure: I am one with a thumbnail knowledge and found myself wanting more to ground me. <em><strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This book started as a collection of resources to be shared on our university’s Pressbooks network; I didn't think it needed peer review when I first started writing it. But as I wrote the preface, I realized that I’d made a radical departure from the pedagogy I’d been using in my literature courses. This book is advocating for a shift in the way we teach the humanities. Once I realized this, I considered working with an academic publisher—a press that would help me put these ideas into scholarly circulation. But this desire to engage with others in the field conflicted with my practical goals for the book. I wanted readers to be able to remix resources in the book to suit their goals in the classroom and found that publication options were limited for a book with a CC-BY license. I knew I didn't want to put energy into something that instructors wouldn’t be able to remix for their classrooms (I’ve encountered many incredible textbooks that I would still be using today if it was possible to revise them for my courses). It is possible there is a press that would not charge me to produce an openly licensed book, but that seemed at the time very unlikely.

I wrote to my OER colleagues for advice. Ed Beck shared an example of how he facilitated a peer review process for <a href="https://civilizacion-hispanoamericana.pressbooks.sunycreate.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Civilización Hispanoamericana</em></a> and Apurva Ashok reminded me of the <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/reviews/rubric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Textbooks Review Criteria</a> (suggested by the <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/reviews/rubric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOERS tenure and promotion matrix</a>). I decided to work with my library to design a peer-review process that would help me learn what literature scholars across different institutions thought of the resources in this book and the critique of humanities pedagogy they imply. Amber Montano became my editor and I’m revising this description of our open peer review process after receiving the first batch of reviewer reports (some anonymized by Amber) in June 2025. These reports were incredibly helpful (and you can click below to read them). It is worth noting that I started writing this book in May 2024 and I’m publishing a peer-reviewed edition in July 2025. I’m pretty happy with that timeline.

I admire Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s use of open peer review and considered circulating a manuscript before publishing the book as she did with <a href="https://kfitz.info/planned-obsolescence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planned Obsolescence</a>, <a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12108/generous-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Generous Thinking</a>, and <a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12787/leading-generously" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leading Generously</a>. I was also impressed by the open peer review processes used for the creation of many open educational resources. The standard when I completed the <a href="https://rebus.community/open-publishing-projects-certificate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebus Open Publishing Projects Certificate</a> was to circulate a Google Doc manuscript with comments enabled (a variation on the <a href="https://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentpress plugin</a> that Fitzpatrick used for her projects). Editors using this process circulated a call for reviewers through announcements on listservs, social media, and forums, meaning there were often many more reviewers than the two in a traditional peer-review process. In each of these cases, reviewers could see what other reviewers were saying, which made it possible for the manuscript to serve as a springboard for conversation between reviewers. Because I anticipated this book prompting wildly divergent responses (from the enthusiastic to the horrified) and because I wanted to capture those individual impressions, we decided to collect individual reader reports and publish the ones we were given permission to share. I took inspiration from <em><a href="https://intransition.openlibhums.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[in]Transition: Journal of Videographic Film &amp; Moving Image Studies</a></em><em>, </em>which makes reviewer feedback public alongside published work.
<div class="textbox">

</div>
In all open peer review processes I’d encountered, the manuscript was revised before the work was officially published and that manuscript (with reviewer feedback attached at the line level) remained accessible even when the revised version was published. But that wasn’t possible for me since I am updating the book with each new edition. I published the March 2025 edition on our pressbooks network before the first round of peer review and then made revisions before releasing the July 2025 edition (what you’re reading now). I am making the version history of this book public in a repository on GitHub. There, a reader can download the Pressbooks XML of each edition, deciding which version they want to use for their own remix.

</div>
The process of peer review for this book allows reviewers to remain anonymous or not, to be acknowledged publicly or not, and to make their review public or not. You can see the public reviews below with some responses from me as notes. The anonymous reviews have also proven incredibly helpful; these will remain an important part of my process as this book grows. The ideas in this book are new and they are still in creation. Readers with opinions about this book (even readers who decide not to adopt it for their courses) are welcome to review it and I will address their responses when I revise the book next summer.

</div>
I’ve made many revisions to the book this summer, but I want to comment on a few here to illustrate how the process has worked.

One reviewer’s feedback about the design of Algorithms and the Arts has prompted me to share more about the history of the course and my plan for the next time I teach it. I did this for each of the courses I include in the book; these notes appear just below course descriptions.

Most reviewer questions have prompted me to expand "Strategies for Teaching Literature with Student-Selected Texts." Following Fitzpatrick's lead, I have mentioned when reviewer feedback has prompted me to add new material to the chapter.

Reviewers who explored the first prototype of WonderCat (a relational database that supports the pedagogy in this book) reported understandable confusion. We devoted our attention to structuring and visualizing data, leaving little time to refine the user experience. We are working this summer to make it easier to navigate, but this remains a work in progress. If you want to join our WonderCat mailing list, please fill out the form below. We will be in touch as we roll out new features and will be very grateful for any feedback you want to share about your experiences with the tool.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I find it useful to draw pictures when I'm trying to wrap my head around new things. I started illustrating the basic structure of these courses with loops. I started off creating loops in <a href="https://miro.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miro</a>. I think it looks kind of like a lightbulb.

This section includes assignment sequences for courses that I have taught with the strategies in this book. I have found a basic structure that works in my classroom that is best illustrated with the image below. All courses in this section are built around four major assignments that ask students to narrate their experience with a creative work they've chosen. The basic structure of the assignments is the same so students get more comfortable with the process as they make their way through the course. I've made slight modifications and adjustments to this basic assignment for different areas of emphasis.

[caption id="attachment_561" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-561 size-large" src="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/12/2025/07/MiroLoopingStudent-1024x1017.jpg" alt="a series of lines looping upward through rectangles (labeled &quot;student selects something new to read&quot;) and then four arrows pointing down from a rectangle labeled &quot;student revisits selected texts for final project&quot;" width="1024" height="1017" /> A student's journey through the course (bottom to top)[/caption]

But that illustration just shows one student making their way through a course. In reality, you have a class of 20 (or 35...or 40!) students looping in many different directions. That can seem overwhelming, but it's really quite fun. I tried to illustrate that the chaos is organized within specific assignments and the shared activities all students do as they loop in lots of different directions. Here's what the basic structure looks like when used in a course like Nineteenth Century Literature. I played around in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illustrator</a> and <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> to create this. The loops remind me of <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/seeing-invisible-event-displays-particle-physics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particle tracks through a bubble chamber.</a>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Connection</h1>
&nbsp;
<h1><strong>Courage</strong></h1>
<strong>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it.</strong>

<strong>Neurochemical Experience</strong>: Courage begins in the amygdala, which senses danger and panics, triggering our “sympathetic nervous system, our periaqueductal gray matter, and the other components of our brain’s threat-response network to release a mix of adrenaline and natural opioid painkillers, boosting our heart rate, numbing our hurt, and filling us with energy” (35). This biological response is meant to help us flee dangerous situations, but it “can be converted into bravery through the addition of one more neural ingrediate: oxytocin.” Oxytocin bonds mothers to newborns. The release is made by our pituitary gland, “a more courageous part of our inner brain that sits just below our amygdala in a bone command bunker, the sella turcica. Whe the pituitary recognizes that there are “other endangered humans in our vicinity, it releases oxytocin.

<strong>Benefit</strong>: Referred to as "tend and befriend" in the scientific literature, the experience of courage prompts human beings to help others in a crisis. “In times of chronic danger, such as famine or plague, tend and befriend encourages us to share our food and our medicines with the other threatened people sensed by our pituitary. And in times of acute danger (like an ambush), it prompts us to band together in a combat pack. Within that pack, we’re more likely to endure than as a fleeing person. We can stave off—even conquer—threats that would devour us alone" (35)
<h1>Forgiveness</h1>
<h1>Love</h1>
While reading, you...
<h1>Trauma Reduction</h1>
<h1>Wonder</h1>]]></content:encoded>

An astonishingly original way of teaching that uses novels, poems, plays, and comics to do more than impart technical skills—it uses them to cultivate personal purpose, emotional wholeness, self-insight, and other forms of human intelligence that cannot be replicated by computer AI.

A radically empowering curriculum that places each student’s unique background, individual psychology, and creative potential at the center of the classroom, inviting learners to grow their love of reading and their capacity for imaginative scholarship by partnering with teachers to co-create a syllabus that generates new knowledge.

A rigorous method, rooted in neuroscience and biology, and continually refined via large scale data collection and expert analysis, through a democratic network open to millions worldwide.

That is what Mary Isbell has created. And what you, dear reader, are about to discover in this book.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This glossary is an ever-expanding collection of experiences from readers of literature, arranged alphabetically. Beneath each experience is a brief definition (including any other terms we treat as synonyms), a neuroscientific explanation of the experience, and benefits that have emerged from the experience.
<h1>Connection</h1>
&nbsp;
<h1><strong>Courage</strong></h1>
<strong>The feeling of being genuinely afraid of something and simultaneously bold enough to face it. Also referred to as "bravery."
</strong>

<strong>Neurochemical Experience</strong>: Courage begins in the amygdala, which senses danger and panics, triggering our “sympathetic nervous system, our periaqueductal gray matter, and the other components of our brain’s threat-response network to release a mix of adrenaline and natural opioid painkillers, boosting our heart rate, numbing our hurt, and filling us with energy” (35). This biological response is meant to help us flee dangerous situations, but it “can be converted into bravery through the addition of one more neural ingrediant: oxytocin.” Oxytocin bonds mothers to newborns. The release is made by our pituitary gland, “a more courageous part of our inner brain that sits just below our amygdala in a bone command bunker, the sella turcica. When the pituitary recognizes that there are “other endangered humans in our vicinity, it releases oxytocin.

<strong>Benefit</strong>: Referred to as "tend and befriend" in the scientific literature, the experience of courage prompts human beings to help others in a crisis. “In times of chronic danger, such as famine or plague, tend and befriend encourages us to share our food and our medicines with the other threatened people sensed by our pituitary. And in times of acute danger (like an ambush), it prompts us to band together in a combat pack. Within that pack, we’re more likely to endure than as a fleeing person. We can stave off—even conquer—threats that would devour us alone" (35)
<h1>Forgiveness</h1>
<h1>Love</h1>
While reading, you...
<h1>Trauma Reduction</h1>
<h1>Wonder</h1>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this class, you are going to read literature and you are going to write about your experiences reading. That sounds pretty straightforward, right? I’m willing to bet it will be different than you expect.

To help you understand what we’re going to be doing together this semester, I want you first to get out a sheet of paper and something to write with.

Now, I want you to imagine that the radiator in the corner of our classroom is a secret passage into a room that very few people know about. Imagine that instead of standing in front of you as I am doing on this, our first day of class, I’m walking over to that radiator, pressing a button underneath, and it’s opening (it flips up slowly, like the DeLorean in <em>Back to the Future</em>…or a Tesla Model X). Let’s all close our eyes as we imagine ourselves going through this passageway. Each of your imaginations is going to supply a much better experience if your eyes are closed.

As we go through the passage, we enter The Station: a space filled with people who are about to begin or have just returned from a journey. Natural light fills the space. There are hundreds of windows. Enormous stone arches create a vast airy space in the main vestibule where we’re standing, but there are many levels. The acoustics are calming. There are tons of people, but the sounds of their footsteps and conversations are slightly dampened. We’ll just stand here right in the middle as people plan to depart or weave through fellow travelers to exit. Don’t worry. We’re not bothering anyone. I bring groups in here all the time.

I can tell you all feel a little awkward to be standing here in a clump with me. Some of you are looking at me like “where have you brought us?” I believe in my teacher heart that some of you are reservedly excited.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people traveling here and there. But then also it’s none of the things that make those places annoying. No people running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screeching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding.”

The first time I came here, I couldn’t figure out how it could be so busy and so calm at the same time. I assumed that when one is in any kind of transportation hub, at least some people will be in a hurry to get to the appropriate departure gate on time. But that’s not happening here. Look around…nobody is in a hurry. People are chatting, reading books, someone over in the corner there is sketching in a notebook. How is everyone so relaxed?

I’ll tell you. It is because there are no departure gates here.

At The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right over here, there’s someone departing right now. That’s Toby. He’s here all the time.

Come closer so you can all see…he’s decided where he’s going, so he’s walking up to one of the windows on the first level.

Seriously, it’s okay for you to watch. He doesn’t care.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said, “Uzumaki.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don’t think he’s scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that’s right. He’s gone now. Not just, like, outside the window. He’s on a journey to Uzumaki.

Now the glass is glass again. See? You can tap on it. You can tap it too if you want.It's important to me that you understand that The Station is filled with all of the excitement and anticipation of travel and none of the frustration that goes along with getting to your destination. But I wish I could describe it better. I wish I could help you experience the wonder of unchecked possibility. Because I bet it sounds to you like make believe.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it according to your own taste, assuming you have interests that you can supply to help you imagine this magical place. I know I can’t please you all.

Let’s try again to imagine The Station. To me, it is a lot like Grand Central Station (huge, vaulted ceiling, very calming), but now I want you to imagine a building that creates awe for you. Maybe it’s a building you hope to visit someday that you’ve only ever seen in a film. Maybe it’s a building from your past that is special to you. It could be a house—or even a special room inside a house. Take that space and transform it into a station in your imagination. There’s certainly a notable sound experience. I’m partial to the dampened acoustics of Grand Central, but maybe you imagine music. What are the smells? Is it the smell of a particular kind of food? The temperature should be perfect, whatever that means to you. The only change you need to make to the space you imagine is that there is some sort of surface that can become a portal to a destination. Because through the station you have imagined, you can go anywhere you want.

Now that you’ve got a good grasp on this feeling of possibility, I have a question for you. Do you know where you want to go? What are you going to say when you approach a window? Not to freak you out or anything, but for this class, you’ll be needing to depart on your first journey in a couple of weeks.

Maybe you’ve got an idea already. If so, excellent. But if you’re anything like me, the enormity of unchecked possibility can make it sort of hard to decide. You might have heard this referred to as “the paradox of choice.” When everything is an option, it’s almost impossible to remember the places you’ve wanted to visit in the past. And this doesn’t even account for the overwhelming feeling that there’s some perfect destination that you don’t even know about yet. If you’re feeling nervous about making a choice, just remember that you can go on as many journeys as you want.

But for now, I want to invite you to think once more about the station you have imagined. And as soon as you’re done looking around in this space, I want you to open your eyes and write down exactly what you imagined, with as much detail as possible. I’ll give you some time to do this and then we’ll discuss.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

Welcome to The Station. I’m guessing by the way you’re gazing around that you haven’t been here before?

It’s incredible, right? It’s something about the combination of natural light that’s coming in, and the stone arches, and the marble floor, and the murals on every surface that isn’t a window (200,000 windows, to be precise). Yes, they are shaped like diamonds though I can't tell you the exact reason why.

I’ve always struggled to put into words exactly how it feels to be in this space. It’s all of the things I love about train stations and airports: loads of people hustling here and there, the acoustics (everything slightly dampened so it’s like this hushed loudness...very calming...like Grand Central Station).

But then also it’s none of the things that make those places terrible. No running down a sweltering platform to catch the final train of the night. No loud screetching of brakes and wheels on rails, no airport security to go through, no “paging John Smith, your plane is boarding." There's a massive arrival and departure board, but no one's staring at it anxiously.

Can you believe that there was a time when people had to travel by horse, or travel for months on the ocean to reach their destinations? That departure and arrival board—the idea that there could be a regular schedule so that anyone could buy a ticket to join other travelers to get pretty much anywhere on Earth…what a stunning feat of human engineering! But, our departure and arrival board is more like a museum piece. Kind of like, see over there? In that corner is an Airstream trailer. You can go inside and sit down and have a snack (endless s'mores). And over there is a stagecoach. You can climb up and crack the whip (they don’t keep the horses here anymore…people kept feeding them).

Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, right. The departure and arrival board doesn’t mean anything (they keep it running because it looks cool). We don’t use it because at The Station you can leave for a destination the second you decide where you want to go. If you look right behind you, it looks like someone is departing right now. Oh yes, that's Toby. He's here all the time.

Come closer so you can see…he's decided where he's going so he's walking up to a free window.

Did you hear what he said? He whispered it so you might not have caught it. He said “Howard’s End.” See how there’s this faint etching of words appearing on the glass? That’s going to fade in just a moment as he…ah, he did it. He went to touch the etched glass and his hand went through it. He just climbed right through the window. No, I don't think he's scared…he’s done this before.

Yeah, that's right. He's gone now. Not just like, outside the window but on a journey to Howard's End.

Now the glass is glass again. You can tap it if you want. Yeah, I honestly don't know how it works. Some people have been studying it...they've published articles on the physics of this particular place and why it's different than other transportation hubs.

Oh, and look over there! A whole family is going together! The dad is whispering to the window and…they’re all just diving in head first! Yeah, you can definitely go on a journey with other people. It happens all the time.

Oh, don’t worry. Toby can come back whenever he wants. Look over here, someone’s just arriving from a journey. See those massive tubes of frosted glass in the center there? They're all bending toward the center of The Station.

Yes, good point! They ARE a little bit like those tubes at the bank! It's kind of like everyone's in their own little cylinder. I guess they never quite found a mechanism quite so elegant as that.

It’s pretty fun to see people flying back from their journeys. The designers really focused on making the experience of returning pleasant. You just feel like you’re floating as you enter the station—all of your limbs are supported in exactly the right way. It feels like a million little puffs of the perfect temperature of air. I think it smells a little bit like popcorn and Parmesan cheese when I come back. Like puppy paws, you know? Maybe that’s just me though, others have said it smells like sunbum sunscreen. Maybe it’s whatever smell you love the most?

Here, let's ask someone.

Excuse me. Um, hi. I see you’ve just returned from a journey. Can I ask you sort of a weird question? What did it feel like as you returned to The Station?

“Like I was being hugged, but not too tight. And…it smelled like the leaves of a tomato plant. Sorry, uh…I have to go submit my experience”

"Oh yes, of course. Don't let me keep you."

Yeah, I'll definitely explain what's happening now. It'll be very new to you, I think. He's going over to that red glowing sphere in the center of the room. It's called RED. To me, it has darkroom vibes. You seem pretty young. Did you know that before digital cameras and smartphones people had to develop their film before they could see their pictures? The photographic materials are very sensitive to light, so in order to see what they were doing, photographers would use red light in the room.

Oh, sorry to have assumed you wouldn't know. You totally get it then. Darkroom vibes. Everyone's illuminated by RED's glow over there. Pretty magical.

Yeah, so he just plopped down in one of the comfy chairs around RED...he's looking at his notebook, scribbling a bit. It seems like he took notes on his journey. Some people just rely on what they remember, but most people (myself included, to be honest) take notes on their journeys. If you want to submit something to RED, you just find a spot to sit and take a little time to process your journey. There are people he can talk to about his experiences...he’s also going to try to figure out what exactly prompted those experiences. There's nothing really extra special about the people he's talking to, no...they're just fellow travelers. Once he’s processed a bit, he’s going to put his hand on RED to submit his experience. That part is super cool. Let's wait a bit and see if we can see someone doing that.

[drums fingers...waits awkwardly]

I mean, you could go talk to him and help him think about his journey. Do you want me to introduce you? You could just say, like... "hey, Brah. What was it like where you went?"

No?

Well, you can just say whatever. Or, you don't have to. You do you.

[...]

Oh, good. whew. Someone's going up to RED. You see how when she puts her hand on the surface of the glass it glows? If we were close enough (but we really shouldn't crowd her) we'd be able to see that it's bringing up different options for her to select. It's like navigating a smart phone...it even has that sort of haptic thing where you feel a satisfying clunk as you drop the experience you've chosen into the right spot. And then it says really nice things to you when you take the time to try to identify what it was about the trip that caused your experience. Yeah, like "what a clever observation" and "wow, you just made someone's day sharing that!"

Just don't put something in the wrong place or it'll electrocute you!

HAHA...just kidding. That won't happen. There is no wrong answer with RED. I mean the tool will sort of organize what you submit to make it as useful as possible to other travelers, but whatever you put in there stays just as you put it. You can go back and look at all of the experiences you've logged over time, which is actually super fun.

No, he doesn’t HAVE to enter his experiences there. No requirement to submit experiences to RED. Most people (myself included) do it because they want others to know how great their journeys were. Everyone is different of course so people can have very different experiences visiting the same place, but sometimes people come to the station and don’t really have any ideas about where they want to go. They just go up to RED, peruse the places other travelers have gone, and decide what they want to try.

Oh, there is one thing that RED doesn't like...I actually accidentally did it when I first started coming here. I'd gone on a journey and completely could not process what happened while I was there. They spoke a different language there, and there were all sorts of jarring sensations. It was pretty uncomfortable and when I came back I was like "I can't put that into RED! I don't want to muddy up the experiences with this hot mess." So I asked around to other people who had been there before. I found this guy who had the most brilliant things to say about the language. I didn't realize it wasn't allowed at that point...I just selected things that sounded like what he told me and found a random detail in my notes to throw in to make it seem real. Even before I finished my submission a fellow traveler came up and said "wow, that doesn't seem like the sort of thing you've said before...tell me more about that experience" and I said "Oh, uh...I didn't know what to say so I asked other people." She said to me in the kindest way...like, I really wasn't afraid..."come with me." She took me over to this quiet spot in the back of The Station. There was music playing---like the minecraft soundtrack or maybe it was that music they put on in spas? And she asked me to sit down on this really comfy couch. She sat across from me and she said "tell me what it was like." And I told her. I told her all of the messy details. She smiled and nodded and--I couldn't believe it--"THAT," she said, "is what you need to put into RED. That is a brilliant observation! She was amazing.

</div>
Okay, I can tell you're ready to go. Lots of people navigate The Station completely on their own and you can totally do that too as soon as you’re ready. I’ve been traveling through The Station for YEARS (some might say millenia). I love explaining how it works, but I'm learning how to be quiet and let people do what they will. I'll be here if you have a question. I love questions!

Okay.

Good luck! And have fun.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Reading lists are invaluable when all students in a course have enthusiastically signed up to study particular texts. But this is not often the situation in literature courses, especially university courses that fulfill degree requirements. In these courses, students have varying levels of familiarity with and interest in literature. When groups like this encounter assigned reading, it is only natural that some students will read carefully, some students will skim, and some students will skip reading altogether (opting instead to read a summary or wait for class discussion to get a sense of what's going on). The resources in this book work with this natural inclination in our students. These assignments and tools support a radically different way of structuring a literature course, removing the barriers that often interfere with the genuine experience of wonder.]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Very few students in my literature courses read the texts I assign.

Early in my career, I would enter the classroom in ignorance of this fact, prepared to draw on students’ reading experiences to facilitate a discussion that would increase curiosity, reveal biases (my students’ and my own), and inspire a richer understanding of the texts I’d so wisely put on our syllabus. My goal was to facilitate an improvised discussion (not a predetermined lecture) with each participant riffing on the others’ commentary.

Over time, I got better at drawing out the truth of my students’ reading experiences. What I learned was that most hadn’t <em>actually</em> read. Instead, they had skimmed summaries and commentary to find something to say during class. While our discussions were filled with discoveries, it was hard to bring the discussion back to the text because it wasn’t emerging from it. Instead of my dream of an improvisation, I was conducting a performance of preparedness, with dutiful students sharing genuine reactions they’d written in a required response paper and others paraphrasing what they’d gathered from a quick survey of the Internet.

I have finally recognized that I cannot facilitate a rich discussion of assigned reading with unwilling participants. At my university and many others, literature courses fulfill general education requirements, which means many students come into these courses motivated by something other than excitement about my reading list. These circumstances are not conducive to my dream of authentic discussion. Improvisation doesn't work so well when the band is required to perform (and not everyone remembers their instrument).

Once it occurred to me that students might not want to read what I was assigning, I found myself encouraging actual reading the way my dental hygienist emphasizes the importance of flossing. “I know it’s extra work, but it’s important!” Try as I might with collaborative annotation and other technologies (little travel-sized containers of floss), I couldn’t make my students read. And the exercise was demoralizing. Experiencing literature should not be like flossing your teeth.

I was working with colleagues across the humanities to find strategies to address this when I found <em>Wonderworks: Literary Invention and the Science of Stories</em>. In it, Angus Fletcher presents narrative technologies (like the plot twist and the soliloquy) as inventions and explains how they do work on our brains. He does this by explaining the neuroscience behind a range of human experiences with narrative. The most fundamental of these experiences is wonder, the uplifting emotional experience of discovery that makes us pause in astonishment as we encounter creative works.

I realized that while wonder is what inspired me to pursue a career as a literature professor, my students were very rarely reporting this experience while reading what I’d assigned. In fact, I was almost always encouraging them to admit when they didn’t like what I’d assigned in the interest of helping them write authentically. Could this emphasis on the emotional experience of literature be a solution? I wrote Angus an e-mail and asked him how he was teaching literature. Step one, he said, was to eliminate assigned reading so students could follow their own interests. He shared the techniques he was using with MFA students and very generously agreed to answer my questions as I adapted that technique for use in literature courses.

I had already seen the power of student-selected texts in first-year writing courses (inspired by Ryan Crawford’s <em>Emotional Value in the Composition Classroom</em>). But everything I’d experienced about teaching literature took for granted that my students should all read the same text. I had no idea how this could possibly work, but I had to admit that what I was doing wasn’t working either. Even the best class discussions left me feeling like students were doing their best to say things one <em>should</em> say in a literature class. So, I experimented with a survey course in spring 2024. It was rocky at first, but my students were willing to explore with me and by the end of the semester we’d found the structure I'm sharing in this book:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Agency</strong>: instead of working together to interpret an assigned reading, students select their own texts within the parameters of the course and are given the responsibility of bringing them into class discussion.</li>
 	<li><strong>Discussion</strong> is organized around elements common to all stories. For example, the elements of narrative. Students take the lead in exploring instances of each element in the story they've chosen.</li>
 	<li><strong>Experience:</strong> instead of typical English papers (interpretive, argument-driven, contextualized with secondary scholarship), students produce careful descriptions of their actual reading experiences, identify the narrative technologies that prompted those experiences, and experiment with those technologies in creative projects.</li>
 	<li><strong>Feedback</strong>: instead of assigning secondary reading or giving a lecture to front load what is known about a specific text, I share context and suggest further reading when giving feedback on individual projects. Feedback on assignments is not an assessment of correctness so much as a conversation that nudges students to keep exploring.</li>
 	<li><strong>Audience</strong>: students have the option of sharing their work with classmates on a course website that is private during the semester. They also have the option of making their work public on the same website when it is made public at the end of the semester. Students are writing for each other and future students.</li>
</ul>
Aside from my occasional fear that the curriculum committee would burst in and charge me with crimes against the literature survey, I thoroughly enjoyed teaching the course. Student reflections and course evaluations reinforced my sense that the change had been transformative. Students reported appreciating the freedom to explore and many shared that they were analyzing far more than they ever had with assigned reading. Why? Because they were curious and wanted to figure things out for themselves.

Needless to say, I think of my students as co-creators of this book; I could not have found this method if they hadn’t shared their experiences with me. I know that each time I use this method I will make more changes, and I’ve openly licensed this book because I expect that this approach will be most useful to others if they also feel free to adapt and modify what I’ve gathered here.

I spent that entire semester and the months that followed interrogating this practice and trying to understand how and why it worked. I started by tracing the role of assigned reading in the long history of literature instruction, discovering that a practical consideration—the scarcity of physical texts and information about them—had established a practice that was no longer necessary in the Information Age. I grappled with the parallels between the professorate and the clergy in interpreting texts for the betterment of humanity, concluding that even if I wanted to transform lives by helping students appreciate the brilliance of George Eliot or Charles Dickens or Jane Austen (and I have wanted this), I have rarely inspired more than 30% of a class to <em>experience</em> their work. And without actual reading, any appreciation that emerged was for my analysis (instead of the authors I most wanted students to experience).

Of course, it still seems blasphemous to suggest setting aside a practice that is, to many, the defining feature of a literature class. How could I teach a class in which students might not encounter the authors I most admire? I found myself wanting to ask these authors what they thought about their work being required and I realized that I could use story to think through these questions. Once the idea occurred to me, I couldn’t stop imagining conversations with my favorite authors.

My first attempt involved Charlotte Brontë bursting her way into one of my dreams to scold me for requiring my students to read her novels. Her complaint was that from her position in heaven (a heaven where dead authors can observe how people on earth are experiencing their works) she was pained by the bad attitudes my students were bringing to her work. She came up with an elaborate analogy to help me understand, asking me to consider what it would be like if my mother required my entire family to read my most recent article before coming to Thanksgiving and then facilitating a seminar-style discussion about it after pie.

I then imagined what George Eliot would say about required reading and her angle was entirely different. It was far more about the experience for the student than her legacy (she was no longer alive, she reminded me). I imagined myself in a rare book reading room, consulting manuscript pages of <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> and finding an addition, very faint in the margins of the second book of the novel (the chapter detailing Tom Tulliver’s painful education in classics and geometry). Just next to the teacher’s observation to his young pupil (“You feel no interest in what you’re doing, sir”), she’d written in the margin “How often are we Mr. Stelling, so committed to the value of what we teach that we neglect the importance of curiosity?” As I looked around the room, amazed at my discovery, she appeared. “I’m not sure why I left that bit out—it’s quite good,” she said as she sat down at the table next to me. We chatted for hours.

In short, I saw my students having a blast experimenting with the narrative technologies in the stories they chose to read and I wanted in on the fun. Imagining these conversations helped me reflect on my role as a literature professor.

Perhaps the percentage of students who read what we assign has dropped over the years. Or perhaps our shift away from lecturing makes it much easier to recognize something that was always happening (I certainly bullshitted my way through a few discussions as a student). I don’t think it matters which it is or if it’s worse now than it used to be because I believe the solution is in our curriculum.

I should also say that I don’t believe a rich discussion of assigned reading is an unattainable ideal that has never existed for anyone. I am a professor today because I participated in these discussions as an undergraduate; I know how transformative they can be because I experienced many more as a graduate student. My goal in developing these resources for required courses (that is, courses that fulfill general education requirements) is to inspire students to seek out opportunities for these discussions in more advanced courses where assigned reading would be a welcome roadmap for learning.

The most important thing, I think, is that we encourage students to search for wonder in whatever period or genre we are teaching. The second most important thing is that we give them the tools to make sense of their experiences reading. I want to inspire students to read more—much more than I could ever force, cajole, or encourage them to read in a single semester. I want them to reclaim their agency as readers. That’s a tall order, but I think this new structure is a step in the right direction.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I didn’t think this book needed peer review when I first started writing it. It started as a collection of resources to be shared on our university’s Pressbooks network. But as I wrote the preface, I realized that I’d made a radical departure from the pedagogy I’d been using in my literature courses. This book is advocating for a shift in the way we teach the humanities. Once I realized this, I started hunting for an academic publisher—a press that would help me put these ideas into scholarly circulation. But this desire to engage with others in the field conflicted with my practical goals for the book. I wanted readers to be able to remix resources in the book to suit their goals in the classroom and found that publication options were limited for a book with a CC-BY license. I understand why there are very few publishers willing to take on a project like this, but I didn’t want to put energy into something that instructors wouldn’t be able to remix for their classrooms. I’ve encountered many incredible textbooks that I would still be using today if it was possible to revise them for my courses. There are many brilliant books that I value but have stopped using because remixing isn’t something one does with a traditionally published textbook.

I wrote to my OER colleagues for advice. Ed Beck shared an example of how he facilitated a peer review process for <a href="https://civilizacion-hispanoamericana.pressbooks.sunycreate.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Civilización Hispanoamericana</em></a> and Apurva Ashok reminded me of the <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/reviews/rubric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Textbooks Review Criteria</a> (suggested by the <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/reviews/rubric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOERS tenure and promotion matrix</a>). I decided to work with my library to design a peer-review process that would help me learn what literature scholars across different institutions thought of the resources in this book and the critique of humanities pedagogy they imply. Amber Montano became my editor and I’m revising this description of our open peer review process after receiving the first batch of reviewer reports (some anonymized by Amber) in June 2025. These reports were incredibly helpful (and you can click below to read them). It is worth noting that I started writing this book in May 2024 and I’m publishing a peer-reviewed edition in July 2025. I’m pretty happy with that timeline.

I admire Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s use of open peer review and considered circulating a manuscript before publishing the book as she did with <a href="https://kfitz.info/planned-obsolescence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planned Obsolescence</a>, <a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12108/generous-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Generous Thinking</a>, and <a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12787/leading-generously" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leading Generously</a>. I was also impressed by the open peer review processes used for the creation of many open educational resources. The standard when I completed the <a href="https://rebus.community/open-publishing-projects-certificate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebus Open Publishing Projects Certificate</a> was to circulate a Google Doc manuscript with comments enabled (a variation on the <a href="https://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentpress plugin</a> that Fitzpatrick used for her projects). Editors using this process circulated a call for reviewers through announcements on listservs, social media, and forums, meaning there were often many more reviewers than the two in a traditional peer-review process. In each of these cases, reviewers could see what other reviewers were saying, which made it possible for the manuscript to serve as a springboard for conversation between reviewers. Because I anticipated this book prompting wildly divergent responses (from the enthusiastic to the horrified) and because I wanted to capture those individual impressions, we decided to collect individual reader reports and publish the ones we were given permission to share. I took inspiration from <em><a href="https://intransition.openlibhums.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[in]Transition: Journal of Videographic Film &amp; Moving Image Studies</a></em><em>, which makes reviewer feedback public alongside published work. </em>
<div class="textbox">
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="https://unewhaven.pressbooks.pub/searchingforwonder/chapter/2025-reviewer-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View Reviewer Reports for March 2025 Edition</a></strong></p>

</div>
In all open peer review processes I’d encountered, the manuscript was revised before the work was officially published and that manuscript (with reviewer feedback attached at the line level) remained accessible even when the revised version was published. But that wasn’t possible for me since I am updating the book with each new edition. I published the March 2025 edition on our pressbooks network before the first round of peer review and then made revisions before releasing the July 2025 edition (what you’re reading now). I am making the version history of this book public in a repository on GitHub. There, a reader can download the Pressbooks XML of each edition, deciding which version they want to use for their own remix. The process of peer review for this book allows reviewers to remain anonymous or not, to be acknowledged publicly or not, and to make their review public or not. You can see the public reviews below with some responses from me as notes. The anonymous reviews have also proven incredibly helpful; these will remain an important part of my process as this book grows.
<div class="textbox">
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="https://github.com/MaryIsbell/WonderCat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Access earlier editions of this book</a></strong></p>

</div>
Like many openly licensed projects, this book is iterative. Peer review is ongoing. The ideas in this book are new and they are still in creation. Readers with opinions about this book (even readers who decide not to adopt it for their courses) are welcome to review it and I will address their responses when I revise the book next summer.
<div class="textbox">
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlxAV05PzDpghmseNVFtbqVoKV56jVWt4nW-4yOL3fk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Serve as a Reviewer</strong></a></p>

</div>
I’ve made many revisions to the book this summer, but I want to note a two here to illustrate how the process has worked.

One reviewer’s feedback about the design of Algorithms and the Arts has prompted me to share more about the history of the course and share my plan for the next time I teach it. This now appears above the course description.

Most reviewer questions have prompted me to expand on some of my points in the "Strategies for Teaching Literature with Student-Selected Texts." I have noted where my expanded sections are in response to reviewer feedback.

Reviewers who explored the first prototype of WonderCat (a relational database that supports the pedagogy in this book) reported understandable confusion. We devoted our attention to structuring and visualizing data, leaving little time to refine the user experience. We are working this summer to make it easier to navigate, but this remains a work in progress. If you want to join our WonderCat mailing list, please fill out the form below. We will be in touch as we roll out new features and will be very grateful for any feedback you want to share about your experiences.

This page gathers reviewer responses received for the March 2025 edition of <em>Searching for Wonder</em>. It is organized according to the open-ended questions we asked reviewers to address. Some of these responses have prompted revisions to the book and I've gestured toward those revisions with footnotes on this page.

</div>
&nbsp;
<h2>Please comment on the clarity of language in the text. Given the audience, we are looking for lucid, accessible prose that provides adequate context for any jargon/technical terminology used.</h2>
<em>Not only is the book clear for fellow educators, the assignments are very clear for students. The idea of education here could have a wider audience than higher education teachers. Perhaps this could be extended to high school teachers who are working with disengaged passenger students. The idea of cultivating wonder and autonomy could also be attractive to alternative forms of education like the unschooling and deschooling movements. </em><strong> -Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>I find the language clear and accessible; the author provides excellent context for, e.g., the different narrative technologies in the glossary and doesn't expect us to internalize them outside that context, and I think the nature of the text's approach lends itself well to a down-to-earth (yet also imaginative and whimsical where appropriate) approach. </em><strong>-Reviewer 5</strong>

<em>The language used throughout was clear and would be clear to students. The one exception is in the glossaries/lists of technologies. This is understandable given that these are the terms students will need to learn to assess and categorize the narratives they have read. But I had some trouble recognizing or understanding some of them from their descriptions, so I don't know that students would understand them. They seemed to prioritize interesting names rather than names or descriptions that would be more readily understandable to first- or second-year gen-ed students. I don't know if many students at my urban commuter public college will know what bank tubes are! </em><strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong>

<em>Searching for Wonder is a book that is easy to skim—due to the straightforward, clear prose. Isbell’s engaging voice makes this book also a joy to read slowly and recurringly. The author shows enthusiasm, curiosity, humor, tenacity, and, of course, wonder in every word.</em>

<em>The student-facing language of the assignments and introductory guided imagery is carefully crafted to be welcoming, kind, and open. Borrowing language from other instructors is always something I’m wary of since, in this era of the LMS and hybrid and fully online courses, much of our teaching personas comes across through written text we’ve published online. My desired persona aligns closely with Isbell’s, so I’d feel comfortable using her text (with attribution of course) without it clashing with my other content. Although Isbell offers her resources to use in full, I imagine that many will want to either adjust the phrasing for their own teaching personas or, perhaps, utilize “Dr. Isbell” or “Station Master” as a guide. </em><strong>-Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Caly Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

<em>This is a wonderfully well written book. It is clear and energetic in its expression.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 4</strong>

<em>Overall writing: highly accessible, with a strong voice. This is an author whose desire for productive classrooms and engaged readers is clear. It is also, importantly, not written as if Isbell has found the secret code to unlock good learning for all students in all classes for all instructors. The assignments are balanced and beautifully scaffolded, with links to excellent resources (readings, glossaries). Isbell practices what she preaches, using personal narrative and vivid scene-making to engage the reader.</em>

<em>I will note one statement from the preface that I think could be revised for clarity: “It is powerful to introduce students to literature as a technology that humans invented to respond to environmental problems.“ I think a word other than “environmental” would be more appropriate, if I grasp this correctly. The many words that come to mind: personal, social, political, religious, environmental, existential. etc. etc.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 3</strong>

<em>Searching for Wonder is refreshingly clear and accessible. It provides an invitational approach to rethinking the classroom as a shared space and I appreciated the scaffolded "teaching" the book itself does for readers. Specifically, it demonstrates in a very effective way how to create and maintain a useable vocabulary for reading over a term with students, rather than imagining an abstract group of people who show up to the classroom. I was impressed with how effectively this was done in the voice of an experienced teacher who clearly enjoys teaching and discovering new things with students.</em>

<em>Regarding jargon: I did not find jargon or technical language to be an issue. In fact, when parts of the book highlight other scholarly voices-for example, Angus Fletcher or David Bartholomae-they serve the goals of the book instead of the other way around. It's useful and educational.</em>

<em>Some phrases/concepts might be further developed and/or refined since they do gesture towards a desire to find a common ground (trying not to say "universal") for teachers and students to work with. For example, "new to you" texts is a useful way to get across the big idea that the book is putting forward-that a move away from canonical and literary genre approaches might be liberating and address the current moment of media-dominated frameworks of reading. But the phrase "new to you" is also bit clunky. It hints at the author's earnest attempt to create a kind of jargon-less phrasing specific to that issue, but I found myself wanting something different. I wondered if there might be other catchy phrases that could help with the flow these kinds of classroom projects: "Uninitiated" or, in positive terms, "potentials" - something that links to the larger theme of wonder and discovery that at the same time demonstrates to students that specific words and concepts pointing to a complex idea are not inherently bad if they serve a useful purpose. </em><strong>-Reviewer 2</strong>

<em>The text is accessibly- and engagingly-written.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>It is easy to follow and understand. Your use of hyperlinks for new phrases is valuable and seamless with the reading and comprehension of the book</em>. <strong>-Reviewer 1</strong>

<em>The language here is clear, especially for anyone who teaches literature at a university level and teaches not just in their specialities but also in general education courses. That said, some further definitions of the terms adopted from Angus Fletcher's Wonderworks could be helpful. The terms I'm thinking of are "narrative technologies" and "story experiences"; it is not that these terms are foreign, but rather that I think it would be helpful to have a description of how they are being used specifically in this context. This description could perhaps come from more insight into how Isbell explains these concepts to students.</em> <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>
<h2>Please comment on this text’s potential usefulness in your literature courses. Based on your experience, what could the strategies, assignments, examples, and glossaries in this book make possible in literature courses?</h2>
<em>My upcoming religion and literature course is already set as an exploration of the Catholic literary revival, so I have a limited canon related to the values of my institution. At the same time, I will be able to better engage students with the readings through adopting strategies outlined in this book. The assignments that promote experiential readings of literature with a glossary that enables to speak about their reading with both authenticity and a shared lexicon will improve my commonplace book assignments where they share texts that most affected them. Likewise the presentation of literature as technology will meld perfectly with our discussion of virtuous uses of technology (especially AI). As an educator, I have to reflect more on this because I teach Tools for Conviviality in this course, especially the idea that we should not be shaped by tools, but at the same time, I present literature as a shared experience that shapes us. If literature is a tool, and human dignity resists being shaped by a tool, then I am grateful for the way this books calls me to think more deeply on the relationship between the techne of the writer's craft and the techne of modern technology.</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>The preface acknowledges a challenge I've come across while teaching: university students often come into the English classroom due to a general education requirement rather than out of a love for stories, which can lead to difficulties engaging students in the classroom. Allowing for student choice, student creativity, and student reflection on their actual experiences with narratives will hopefully encourage them to see both how stories are made and why we enjoy them—all through intrinsic motivation (as much as possible within a formal academic context). I'm particularly intrigued by the suggested "Getting Started" exercise in terms of the movement from description to classification of experience. This passage in particular...</em>

<em>"[The creators]created the storyworld, made choices about the plot, decided to narrate the story in a particular way (this involves specific camera angles if you’re looking at film or video games), and crafted characters.

<em>...is a simple way of articulating why students engage in the descriptive and classificatory exercises, and the clarity of the resources in the glossary paired with in-class discussion may help with the problem of students feeling either lost or constrained when faced with talking about their experiences with literature. In open responses, some of my students have mentioned difficulty deciding what to write about in terms of their experiences; when I provide more constraints, the answers often feel like they trend toward "what [they think] I want to hear." The description-classification exercise seems like it might help when paired with the resources in the glossary. It sounds, from the "Strategies" section, that modeling assignments around personal reading/viewing/play experience helps alleviate the regurgitation problem while still providing guidance, so I'm interested to try this moving forward.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 5</strong>

<em>Literature courses at my college are mostly gen-ed offerings, with a few meeting requirements for specific majors, and some minors including a range of literature course offerings in the requirements. So an approach that doesn't emphasize coverage of literature would work for all or most literature courses we offer.</em>
<em>As the book proposes an approach that asks students to observe, detail, and describe, categorize, and reflect on their experiences with narrative and provides tools to do so. These are important techniques for students in any of the majors our college offers, from health fields to engineering, design, and business, etc.</em>
<em>The approach presented in the book also emphasizes the experiences and skills students bring into the course and integrates it into collaborative co-creation of knowledge with each other and the instructor.</em>
<em>The course de-emphasizes grades, focusing on student learning rather than evaluation. It would be useful to understand both the affordances of this approach and what difficulties that creates. Do students all finish with the same A grade? What keeps them from an A if not? What does it mean to give 100% for an assignment if a student didn't do all parts, or didn't get things right? And if those projects don't get 100%, what do they get instead?[footnote]Great questions. I'm adding a note on this to the "strategies" section.[/footnote]</em>
<em>A course schedule would be helpful to understand pacing. This could also include what happens during class time for each of the classes during a project.[footnote]Yes, excellent idea. Adding this.[/footnote]</em>
<em>Revision is one of the expectations of writing-intensive courses, so it's great that the projects include a revision step. That said, I didn't understand what work students were supposed to do in the revision, nor why it was supposed to be done in a google doc rather than in a post or the initial post. A bit more explanation in the "How Does This Work?" section would help instructors considering adopting the approach--putting greater explanation in the assignments themselves could benefit instructors and students.</em> <strong>-Dr. Jody R.

<em>This book is both highly specific—I feel as if I could replicate this exactly in my own class with very little alteration—and deeply flexible. I find myself thinking of ways to adapt Isbell’s concepts and tools for similar applications. Although I do teach literature in some of my courses (as well as film and theatrical performance, which have their own set of similar technologies), I more often teach non-fiction essays. When I teach essays, I draw comparisons between their techniques and those of short stories, films, or other fictional pieces. For example, I ask: How do authors turn the scholars they cite into characters within their essays? How do authors take readers on a journey? Do they set up some exposition before setting off an inciting argument? Do they begin in media res without any explanation to hook readers? I guide students through this process while we all read the same essays, but typically I find myself hoping that they’ll do the same with essays that they encounter on their own, for pleasure (Oh, I hope they read essays for pleasure!) or for citation. Searching for Wonder provides me with a potential framework for guiding my students through a process of reading essays of their choosing and working through and sharing their experiences of reading, classifying, and identifying the technologies used by the authors. This process provides students with agency, the ability to help other students, and also allows us as instructors more opportunities for assessment.</em> -<strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Caly Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

<em>Very practical in its approach and application. The practical pedagogy is a real strength. There is material that can be put to immediate use in the classroom as well as material that could help an instructor reconfigure not only their individual classes but their approach to teaching overall. An instructor could easily adapt any of the particular strategies in a less comprehensive way, not needing to rebuild their entire course from scratch, while the vision is there for a complete overhaul for those who desire it.</em>

<em>One possibility for the future might be to look at more small-scale assignments that can be brought into a more traditional course. Lots of teachers will not have the authority to create an entire course like this but would have the ability to bring in individual assignments. I am thinking especially of adjunct faculty and graduate students who may have to teach to a prescribed curriculum.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 4</strong>

<em>These strategies, assignments, and glossaries enable and encourage students to develop an analytic approach to text--and to fuel that analysis with their own experience as readers. I love that the process of analysis is carefully guided and that the courses use narrative and metaphor (experiments, technologies) to motivate students to be careful and confident analyzers.</em>

<em>I am less comfortable with the lack of shared contexts and frameworks--beyond the course’s engaging methodology. So, for example, students in that “Algorithms and the Arts” course seem (?) to have no shared reading on algorithms to help orient everyone toward technical or historical facts about how they have evolved and how they function across various platforms. I trust Isbell gives that kind of context in her conversations with individual students. But wouldn’t it be better to affirm through an assigned reading that there is scholarship on the topic that is reputable;[footnote]Excellent point. I've now addressed this in the "Assignments in Context" section as I describe "Algorithms and the Arts."[/footnote] that the professor has identified the scholarship that is a helpful starting place and also model for students as they move out into the world to do research; and that the class will value this scholarship as a *shared* resource (like the glossaries and then like their final timeline project) that will not only help each student find wonder but will also help them stay tethered to vetted information and to the collective work of the class.</em>

<em>Isbell empowers students through the use of the word research (and, I would observe, attempts to bolster the credibility of literary study through the use of the word *technologies*). The courses are also designed by someone who holds a PhD and conducts research (research she writes about compellingly in a sample about *The Terror*). If we want students to value the act of research, I think we also need to emphasize that not all research is good or even valid and that we have experts (including in reading and literary history) who have insights and knowledge to share.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 3</strong>

<em>As I mentioned above, the deliberate effort to keep the discussion grounded in teaching is appreciated and useful. I can imagine adapting several of the strategies and frameworks to courses in literature as well as first-year writing/comp. For example, the ways the author approaches assignments as a kind of deep dive into not just a text or set of texts, but rather as an invitation to discover a readerly relationship, is a powerful tool in this time of information saturation. The assignments provide a kind of road map for that journey. In other words, the assignments themselves might be the key to the structure of the whole thing, rather than students working through a tradition, a canon, or a set of genre signposting and identification. It's a different kind of pedagogical process and I can see the possibilities in this approach.</em>

<em>With all this in mind, I would find it difficult to pull from these assignments directly (without adapting them) for use in my own classes. My classes are not centrally literature-based but do include literature, and they are often grounded in learning the historical and social context of a particular moment to help understand the work. If I am asking students to read an experimental novel or a poem/song, for example, that came out of the Chicano Movement or the Black Power Movement, it's not possible to assume the students know those histories. Same goes with thinking about texts that, in part, seek to explore gender, sexuality, class, etc. during a particular moment. Those conversations often take some kind of set up and are anchored on texts in dialogue with the moment. They also rely on certain keywords and concepts, in ways that might overlap with the WonderCat database, that could be helpful (with the option for students to come up with their own if those we read about are not doing the trick). The structure I've developed for this dedicates the first half of the term to reading/viewing/engaging with those relevant conversations (drawing on short essays from the Keywords series published by NYU Press, based on Raymond Williams' cultural studies keywords project). The second half of the course "turns over" a large part of the project to the students as they develop their own research, creative approaches, keywords projects, and collaborations. Students in my classes generally have various opportunities to choose creative texts (novels, films, art) that are not part of the assigned reading and construct their own project around that. I believe Searching for Wonder could inspire adding to and even rethinking the frameworks of the courses I teach, especially the second half. But it would take some time and adjustment to bring them in in a deliberate way. I do look forward to trying to adapt some of these strategies.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 2</strong>

<em>I think this approach would be particularly useful for me in the creative writing classroom, where I find the most students who don't necessarily complete the reading. I often teach literature in the creative writing classroom, so Isbell's approach could help me show the applicability of closely engaging with literature to improving as a creative writer.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>Based on my tenure as a high school literature teacher and presently as an academic instructional librarian, I find this approach to be investigative, authentic, and self-motivating.</em>

<em>I imagine that this student-selected text approach, coupled with these assignments, will be more enjoyable and relevant to the students’ unique lives and interests. It seems likely that this approach might extend itself as a bridge between a literature course requirement and the professional goals and degree most students seek from attending college in the first place, all the while opening a sense of wonder to the characters, the plot, and perhaps even to themselves.</em>

<em>Your adaptation of literary themes and figurative language through “storyworld” and “narrative technologies,” plus the student’s potential to add a new term to the mix is easy to understand and utilize in the making-sense of literature.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 1</strong>

<em>This text will be highly useful for my literature courses. I am especially taken by the way that this text faces, head on, the problem of students' not reading and balances that disheartening recognition with an energy to help students discover the joys of reading by tapping into (and guiding them to discover) the emotions and experiences that they already enjoy. I love this move--that asks students to reflect on their experiences with texts--not just because it seems a perfect way to reading, but also because it gifts the professor insight into their students personally. I have become an even firmer believer in the necessity of learning about my students on an individual level, and Isbell's work integrates that goal into the courses' goals with aplomb. One of the best examples of this arises for me in the first assignment that asks students to reflect carefully on one of their favorite texts. This assignment also, at least implicitly, targets another central goal of mine: stressing to students the personal and contemporary relevance of the texts with which we engage.</em>
<em>Considering further assignments: on reading the "plot summary" assignment, I wanted to rush into any classroom and try it out. This assignment gets students to think about why and how a story works--a goal in all my classes--and does it on so many different levels or through different modes that, I think, would both engage students and challenge them.</em>
<em>The glossaries of both narrative technologies and story experiences would be something I would quickly integrate in class too, if only to help students and myself come to a shared language by which to speak of the texts we explore. That shared language is another "thing" that I see this text making possible in literature courses in which it's often difficult to get students all to the "same page." Importantly, this is not to say that students would feel restricted by this language or the glossaries. One of the advantages I see of these glossaries is that ALL are invited to add to it and that power/possibility alone would generate productive class discussion.</em> <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>

<em>Since I teach at a small religious university where the liberal arts are practically non-existent but we still try to remain in the tradition of liberal education, I resonate with the author's work to make literature accessible for non-majors. This would work well for our first-year</em>
<em>experience courses that focus on literature and could possibly be adapted for our medical humanities program. Since we have a character education initiative, there are ways that the ideas here could work very well for us. The emphasis on autonomy (an intellectual virtue in the Jubilee Centre framework), goal-setting (necessary for students to grow into the kind of persons they want to be rather than just skill acquisition), the role of the teacher as a model (virtue is caught), and the turn toward drawing out love for the practice of reading by that model (love is the motivating virtue after all) all fit very well in our educational culture. At the same time, there are ways that there would be a tension with our curriculum, which could tease out interested aspects about this approach. In cases when education is seen as a way to point to what is worthy of our attention, then what do we lose if we stop pointing to specific literary artifacts? If education is inherently relational, then do we risk atomizing our work further by having students fully select their own texts? I mean these questions as someone who is very open to this project and grateful for the way it allows us to think through more what it means to teach literature.</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>One potential challenge might emerge if, for example, department syllabus approval hinges upon having discrete assigned texts rather than allowing for more open text selection (at my institution, different course groups are overseen by different subject leaders, who may have different standards for approval. However, I could imagine adapting this approach to let students choose among a selection of different texts provided by the instructor (should this please the department).</em>

<em>I would also be curious about scaffolding students who are primarily used to engaging with short-form content; in my experience teaching first-year composition classes, I’ve known some students who claim to only watch TikTok, Instagram Reels, etc. rather than long-form content like watching movies or TV (let alone reading books).[footnote]Yes, I've heard this as well, and I think you could encourage students to select a TikTok for the "getting started" assignment. You could then encourage them to take advantage of the opportunity to move outside what is comfortable: finding a written text, for example, that shares the the technology of "irony" or "reality shifter" (or some other technology they identify in the TikTok they write about).[/footnote] I'd be curious if this is something the author has also encountered or how they might help these students find their footing in the classroom. The proliferation of narrative technologies is alluded to in "Getting Started" assignments, and "Algorithms a the Arts" suggests ways of thinking about technologies in relatable contexts (e.g., YouTube algorithms, music genres as technologies), which provide some possible ways of beginning to approach this problem. I would be interested to hear a bit more from the instructor side of things.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 5</strong>

<em>It's great that students can study their experiences with narrative and map those onto narrative technologies. I like the flexibility to incorporate non-written narratives. But I don't know that a course called literature but in which someone could read no literature would work at my college. I thought the courses that asked students to read different types of narratives for different assignments could mean that students could be ensured to experience different formats of narratives.</em>
<em>There is a useful emphasis on students directing their choices, and mention of the difficulty of making choices sometimes, but no clear solution for overcoming the obstacle when it threatens to slow a student down to the point of not progressing, which I find relatively often when students face a choice rather than being told what to work on. Since there is nothing to get started without a text, I would need to have a way to move students into making a choice so they don't fall behind from the start.[footnote]The goal of WonderCat is to help those who struggle to make a choice, and I would recommend any instructor going into teaching with this method create their own WonderCat account in advance and enter their own experiences with literature they'd ideally like students to encounter. I'm adding this to the "strategies" section of the book.[/footnote]</em>
<em>I don't have a clear sense of how much writing students will produce for the four posts and the final project/revision. I would need to be specific about that to meet the requirements for a writing-intensive course, which all of our literature courses are.</em>
<em>The book addresses the situation of students not finishing the readings they begin, but it doesn't make reference to how much reading to expect of students or that students should expect of themselves, or what taking on too much or too little reading can do to the outcome of the projects.</em>
<em>These variables--which texts, how much to write, and how much to read (or consume)--leave so much choice for students that they might not know if they're on the right track, or how much more they need to do. When assignments offer the option for reading one narrative or more, I don't know what would motivate a student to choose three instead of one without them understanding what having more data offers them (like in the example of categorizing like biologists do).[footnote]I'm revising this prompt to reduce it to just one story. After teaching with it this past semester, I didn't have any students opt to write about more than one so I think it was very much a "too much choice" situation.[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Dr. Jody R.

<em>I could use or adapt the assignments in this text for any of the courses I teach in our English Department. I don’t see the need for this text to address every learning outcome for every course.

<em>Our institution would have no problem implementing courses like this (we have some already), but we're pretty innovative. Having consulted for other schools for which these ideas would be seen as quite radical, I do have some thoughts—</em>
<em>What feels to me to be missing most fully from this text is any philosophical/theoretical background. We get all praxis, very little theory. The preface sets things up nicely, but there is so much rich material out there to support this approach that its lack felt quite noticeable. (Just today I was reading a new essay-review by Dan Sinykin in The Nation about close reading that felt like something worth addressing here.) This text is essentially a toolbox for a course, which is fine and useful, and if that's the only goal, then the text achieves it. But that makes it easier to dismiss than it ought to be.</em>
<em>By "theory" I don't mean abstruse philosophical musings translated from French or German. I'm thinking of conversations throughout the discipline over the decades — in many ways, this text is responding to the "canon wars" of the '80s and '90s, but it's also (whether it knows it or not) drawing from innovations like literature circles. Really, in many ways, what this text is drawing from is the last 30 years or so of reading experiments in primary and secondary schools. There's decades of research on this work and it would, I think, strengthen the text to have reflection on such material. This is innovative stuff for college still, but less so for primary/secondary. And that actually reveals this kind of work to be not brand new but in fact in continuity with what students likely experienced in some way or another before arriving at college.</em>
<em>There's also lots of research out there on different ways of reading — in the passage about helping students use books they don't need to read in their entirety, I thought of Robert DeMaria's really interesting book "Samuel Johnson and the Life of Reading", which proposes that one of the great (and once-upon-a-time canonical) writer-readers of the English language actually had 4 modes of reading for himself, including skimming. Positioning the pedagogy of this text within such structures would make it easier to advocate for these approaches among skeptical faculty and administrators. Reading does not have to be one thing, so we don't need to teach literature as if there is only one way to do it.[footnote]Agreed. This work is important and is very much happening in the background of this book. I am working on writing it up as a more traditional scholarly argument. [/footnote]</em><strong>-Reviewer 4</strong>

<em>I think where Searching for Wonder might make a direct impact at my university is in the writing and composition courses and programs. In fact, not only at my university but at many other universities and colleges. On my campus, for example, we currently have 8 separate colleges each with their own specific, themed writing/project-based first-year courses. Some of the goals of those courses (and other required courses) align closely with the goals of this project - asking students to 1) engage critically with the texts they encounter, which are potentially vast in their form and genres, and 2) to place what they encounter in relation to their previous experiences, the knowledge they bring with them garnered from their own communities, and so on.</em>

<em>I'd recommend that the book consider developing an explicit engagement with first-year writing programs as a specific audience. It was clear to me that those specific classes are in mind, but my impression is that the book is more directly addressing "literature" courses (i.e. classes taught in English departments that are not writing courses). I think Searching for Wonder is useful for both, but perhaps directly addressing the different challenges one faces in teaching a literature course versus a writing/comp course could be useful.[footnote]Yes, absolutely. I have included in "Assignments in Context" my plan to use these methods in the "Seminar in Academic Inquiry and Writing" I'll be teaching in Fall 2025[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Reviewer 2</strong>

<em>Since the literature curriculum at my institution is very based in transmitting a shared knowledge of canonical works in a long literary tradition, I don't think this approach would apply as well there.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>I think these strategies are inventive and engaging. As that is the sincerest foundational need for a literature class, I find the curriculum to be varied, relevant and meaningful to future students.</em>

<em>WonderCat is reminiscent of the Poetry Foundation’s “Topics and Themes” (their way of categorizing for understanding and selection of poems) and the Academy of American Poets, addition of “occasion.” I love this!</em>

<em>I think students will see the value in what you’ve created for them and the respect in which you regard their work and feedback. “If you turn something in, you will receive full credit on this exam.

You are doing the thinking and writing, but I’m the one being evaluated (by myself).”</em> <strong>-Reviewer 1</strong>

<em>At this point, there is still freedom for professors at my institution in terms of accomplishing courses' goals and learning outcomes. In short, we still are designing our courses, assignments, reading lists. So simply in terms of the freedom of texts encouraged here, this text would be appropriate for my use.</em>

<em>I do believe that this text will need to be more explicit about how a professor can use WONDERCAT to direct students to texts in the specific time period, genre, issue, etc. that would be the focus of the course. I see that step as something Isbell has navigated well already considering especially the Nineteenth-Century Literature and Representations of Nature courses. I don't however see that yet explained in this text.[footnote]Yes, excellent point. This summer (2025), we are refining the featuers of WonderCat that will allow users to filter everything in the database by publication date and country of origin. I've expanded "WonderCat, a Discovery Tool" to explain how to make the most of the tool.[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>

<em>As an educator and a deschooler in the tradition of Ivan Illich, dedicated to promoting autonomy and respecting the student's ability to grow to maturity in a field, I am very attracted to this way of opening up literature to student choice. I see also where it can be an essential strategy for changing institutions.</em>
<em>At the same time, I have two concerns about this approach that if addressed could help potential adopters. 1) I am not sure if literature should be reduced to experience with a focus on emotional experience. I think the way this method unpacks that important aspect of literature is compelling, but I want my students to have something more. I want them to see that literature is a form of shared reasoning through story. I have a relational view of literature and technology that I would like to see in an approach to literature. I see where this method accomplished that by emphasizing discussion of shared techniques, but I'm curious how this technique could interface with other views of literature. 2) I am convinced by Gert Biesta that the primary function of teaching is to point at what's worthy of our attention, and to attend to it together with students. I can see where this class method does that so well by facilitating discussions with various student-selected texts, but I would like to see more discussion of what we might lose without assigning texts or how the curation through WonderCat offers another way to attend together as a learning community.[footnote]Absolutely. I have heard this from many colleagues and have addressed it more fully in "Strategies"[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>We might consider formalist analysis or schools of thought following the New Critics at odds with focusing on story experiences and related narrative technologies. The approach to literature in this book—asking students to articulate and creatively explore their experiences with narratives and put those ideas into practice using narrative technologies creatively—is at odds with the legacy of I.A. Richards, Cleanth Brooks, and others who shaped the way that "close reading" is often understood in the classroom. That is to say, the New Critics' take on "close reading" is often about hidden meanings, finding symbolism, and dissecting the text in a way that does not consider readers' emotional responses. The author acknowledges their distance from this approach (not asking students to "interpret" Frankenstein for example), so I think this is clear.</em>

<em>On the other hand, I think there are resonances with reader-response theory as well as narrative theory as a whole. Rhetorical narrative theory, for example, often follows James Phelan's default definition of narrative: "somebody telling somebody else, for some purpose(s) and on some occasion, that something happened." Rhetorical narrative theory asks us to consider authors, resources, and audiences, much in the way that we can consider basic narrative elements (narration/storyworld/plot/character) and narrative technologies as resources authors employ for specific effects on audiences. The in-class activity "Experiments on Emotion" in the "Story and the Brain" section for example, can also be articulated in terms of authorial purposes and audience responses.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 5</strong>

<em>As I read this book, I thought about how I would spend class time with students, and what they would need from me to make this approach work. I think students would need to learn about the different narrative technologies. They might know many--and if they did, they might want to start a list early that they add to all semester. But there are many they don't know, and I don't know how they would complete the assignments without learning what the different technologies are. Is there time devoted to perusing the glossaries or WonderCat?[footnote]Yes, the need for this emerged during the Spring 2025 semester and I've added it to the assignment sequences.[/footnote] Although students can identify experiences using whatever descriptive language they can find, and can then revise based on consensus among the class about how to describe their experiences, I don't know that the same works for narrative technologies. I might want to ask students to read something that explains, say, elements of fiction, or that describes, for example, order, duration, and frequency. Asking students to read about reading literature seems a useful addition, supporting their efforts to understand the metacognitive moves we make when experiencing narratives.</em>

<em>I also wonder if short examples could be shared during class time to have some shared experiences that would motivate the terminology they need to develop and revise throughout the semester.</em> <strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong>

<em>This is a user-centered approach to teaching literature. The focus is on students’ choices, identifications, and experiences. This aligns with the author’s purpose in developing this curriculum, which is, crucially, to get students to read. Isbell convincingly argues that learning and wonder cannot occur until students take the indispensable step of reading.</em>
<em>As Isbell notes, students are used to being asked to interpret texts. This book foregrounds, instead, embodied experiences of reading. It asks students to reflect not just on what they thought or felt about a text, but on what drew them to it. What were they doing while reading? Where was their body in space? Reading Isbell’s example posts demonstrates an entire physical, mental, and individual experience, one that’s framed as meaningful to others, especially through the sharing of blog posts and commenting.</em>
<em>Blog posts remain a format that privileges long-form writing. Isbell states adamantly that they are not English essays—and they clearly aren’t—but are they reflections? Blog posts? Content? I can’t help but feel that categorizing these responses could be important to the mission of the book. The courses may not be so meta as to ask students to assign or ascribe technologies to their own responses, but this kind of attention to genre, purpose, and audience impact seems worth emphasizing. It could encourage a stronger sense of curiosity and wonder as students approach all kinds of texts.</em>
<em>Although the students spend time focusing inwardly on their own experiences, they are also asked to connect their experiences to those of others in Wondercat. By classifying their experiences into existing or new categories, students are building experiential communities that demonstrate the ways that texts work in identifiable and repeatable ways. This reinforces Angus Fletcher’s claims about narrative technologies and the way they work on the human brain.</em>
<em>When reading through the content about the nineteenth-century literature course, I wasn’t sure if the focus stayed entirely on the twenty-first-century experiences of the text or if Isbell or her students were inputting into Wondercat readers’ reactions recorded in nineteenth-century diaries (for example). I wondered if the class discussed how narrative technologies worked across time and in different cultural contexts.[footnote]This is a brilliant idea I had not considered! [/footnote] <strong>-Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Caly Poly San Luis Obispo</strong></em>

<em>I got at some of this in my previous response. There are a lot of theoretical implications that are unaddressed, perhaps because the writer feels that this is primarily a toolbox rather than a theoretical exploration, which is fine as far as it goes, but seems a bit unfortunate to me because there is a whole philosophy behind the work here, and making the philosophy more explicit (and more fully researched) actually would help it all be more relevant and useful to teachers who can't implement the tools in their entirety.</em>

<em>One area of philosophical congruence is in the idea of wonder, which could be more fully explored and expressed throughout. Wonder connects to awe and the sublime, so has a long history in aesthetics that could be used to more fully ground this text in centuries-long traditions — everything from Romanticism up through Jeff VanderMeer's "Wonderbook". There's been lots of research on joy, pleasure, and play in education that this text fits comfortably within.</em>

<em>What gets lost in this approach may be a sense of shared experience of a text. That has great value and ought not to be undermined in hyperindividual approaches. There is joy and play in communities coming together through a single text, and while that is not *this* approach, it's one that many of us would not want to lose. That, too, may be worth addressing more fully — the creation of community through these tools. (It's at least implied via some of the discussion of specific assignments and tools.)</em>

<em>This approach also fits with some ideas of "distant reading" and might benefit from exploring both the advocacy and critique of that concept. </em><strong>-Reviewer 4</strong>

<em>I find that it complements my own turn in the last 5-10 years toward the use of creative assignments, student reflection on text selection, and attention to experience as readers.</em>

<em>That said, I am invested in historicist methods, and I carefully select texts to engage students not only as consumers but also as citizens. In class, we read for aesthetic and rhetorical choices. We also read in order to bridge the gulf between the past and the present--and to learn from the past as we process the present. Obviously, this speaks to Isbell’s goals in the 19thC class, and I am assuming WonderCat will contain many of the works that I teach.</em>

<em>But in this set up, students would be exposed to far fewer of them and would not engage in a *collective* discussion of their *content* (their ideas, values, claims). I find a common student response to my classes (whether surveys, topics, or methods courses) is something like “I learned more about the past in this course than I ever did in my History classes.” I would hate to lose that, and I fear that picking their own readings, examining them largely independent of others, and not receiving literary and cultural historical lectures and overviews guarantees that loss.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 3</strong>

<em>On approaches to literature:</em>

<em>I appreciate the way Searching for Wonder seeks to create a world WITH specific students that are in a classroom at a particular moment. It is a very student-centered approach that goes beyond the usual meaning of that concept; it's not just flipping the classroom but rather trying to deconstruct it together. The author notes throughout that there is something scary about doing this because it counts on uncertainty to some degree. The author's goal is to move away from banking models and move toward genuine experiences that might emerge from reading and creative work.</em>

<em>On tensions with other approaches:</em>

<em>Critical and literary theory and criticism that often informs my own teaching of literature deal with social identity categories, alternative worlds and speculative futures, interrogation of norms, questioning various forms of injustice, and how these things may or may not shape or reflect the lives of people or communities in particular historical moments. My sense is that Searching for Wonder is also interested in those kinds of questions, makes room for them but is not prioritizing them because the goal is to allow for more invitational approaches determined by the students and meeting them where they are. For example, if they don't read they should not be penalized or challenged for that. I believe these are important pedagogical practices.</em>

<em>My question: How does this book think of those kinds of concerns? Is the goal to stay clear of social and cultural theories, or perhaps to service as a platform for beginning those kinds of ways of thinking? In other words, I am interested in how the frameworks and approaches in Searching for Wonder does or does not overlap, align, contradict what might be considered cultural studies, feminist studies, class studies, or other theoretical approaches that have been important shapers of literature courses over the past half century. Feels like a productive kind of question to pursue in future editions![footnote]I would love to adapt these methods for courses like this. I've included thoughts on how this might be approached in the "Strategies" section.[/footnote]</em> <strong>-Reviewer 2</strong>

<em>One thing I would wonder about is how this approach might sideline an appreciation of how texts emerge in literary history alongside similar texts. I anticipate that Isbell would propose that that important goal be served in later literature courses attended by only motivated students.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>The style in which this book affords educators steps to take, in addition to scaffolded examples, is easy to follow and implement. When I taught juniors in high school, this would have been a beautiful way of meaningfully introducing variety and personal interest in texts. Rather than the independent group work of Lit circles, this approach opens itself up to the entire class, and to the online platform. Collaboration paired with personal exploration of a text is a powerful duo.</em>

<em>I appreciate your reflection of the gen-ed level lit class and the modern-age possibility of what it may inspire: “My goal in developing these resources for required courses (that is, courses that fulfill general education requirements) is to inspire students to seek out opportunities for these discussions in more advanced courses where assigned reading would be a welcome roadmap for learning.” </em><strong>-Reviewer 1</strong>

I see the approach to literature here as through a "craft" angle. When I focus on the concerns I see as central to a "craft" angle, I explain to my students that we will be looking at how and why a text "works" and what it "does" to us as its audience. That approach to texts is key to my pedagogy; however, also important is introducing students to the sociohistorical context of the texts with which we engage. This text--most notably in its timeline assignments--convinces me that this approach to teaching attends to sociohistorical concerns. I would, however, like to see more explicit discussion of if/how/when such explorations enter class discussions. I am not expecting (or wanting) to see lectures but wondering if/how such concerns arise in the assignments (and if I missed that in my reading--apologies!). <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>
<h2>Please comment on the internal consistency of the text in terms of terminology and framework.</h2>
<em>As a reader, I have not noticed any inconsistencies. The rethinking of literary techniques as technology is fascinating and clear. My suggestion in this way would not be for increased consistency but for more room to be given to the implications of this shift.</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

The text seems internally consistent and an excellent dialogic partner to Fletcher's Wonderworks. <strong>-Reviewer 5</strong>

<em>I appreciated seeing the consistent approach to assignments, including the patterning and repetition of instructions. There is a reference to returning to the first assignment for instructions, rather than including that information again--which would be too long to include in its entirety. However, a link back to it and perhaps a list of the different steps but with no explanation would be useful there.[footnote]Great idea. Done.[/footnote]</em>

<em>I wondered, though, if this level of repetition, which I value for its consistency, would instead mean that students would overlook what was said, that it would be extra and not internalized. If that were the case, would it make more sense to have a document that addresses, for example, revision, or grading, and then each project's instructions would link to that one document about revision, or grading, rather than repeat all of that information each time.</em>

<em>It was not clear to me when to use the glossaries versus WonderCat.</em> <strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong>

<em>The terminology and philosophy of Angus Fletcher’s Wonderworks is clear without the reader having read that text. Isbell takes Fletcher’s work into her own specific direction. The terminology surrounding the narrative technologies and the processes students move through while reading are clear and consistent across the assignments and their explanations.</em> <em>-</em><strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Caly Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

<em>It's very consistent.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 4</strong>

<em>It is beautifully consistent, well written and engaging.</em> -<strong>Reviewer 3</strong>

<em>The internal consistency is strong, coherent, and allows for the assignments, links, examples, and keywords/glossary to be shaped and reshaped through it. As mentioned above, I thought some terminology (such as "new to you") might continue to be refined. But its meaning is clear and legible</em>. <strong>-Reviewer 2</strong>

<em>I think the work is internally consistent in its terminology and framework.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>I found it to be so.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 1</strong>

I saw internal consistency of terms and framework throughout this text. However, sometimes that consistency introduces little errors--that I fear students would catch--in assignments. For instance, in the Algorithms and the Arts course (LOVE the idea behind this course), the assignments for film and music include some errors, specifically references to story/reading terminology, etc.. Also I wonder if the FAQs for those assignments need to be shifted to film or music specific as well.[footnote]Thank you! Corrected.[/footnote] <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong>
<h2>Please comment on the organization of this text. A pdf edition will be made available upon launch, but this review is focused on the digital edition. Our goal is for the topics of the text to be presented in a logical, clear fashion.</h2>
<em>The text is readable, and the opening sections set the stage well with the explanation of literary technologies and the detailed explanation of the typical class session followed by assignments offered generously in modular design on Pressbooks, and concluding with a searchable glossary. This organization makes excellent use of the digital structure of writing in Pressbooks. At the same time, as a reader, I found myself wanting a formal conclusion after the example projects and before the appendices with the two glossaries. It might be that I missed the rhetorical moves that accomplish this in the opening sections, but I would like to see something that returns all the generous course information in how this way of teaching changes our view of literature, the classroom, and the profession.</em>[footnote]Great point. I added a "Conclusion, of Sorts"[/footnote] <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>On an organizational level, it might be helpful to explicitly draw attention to existence of the two glossaries before the “Assignments in Context” section. Though I didn't feel like I needed the information contained in them earlier per se, I thought it would be nice to know of their existence before seeing the sample course(s) rather than seeing them linked during the context section. Similarly, perhaps it might be helpful for some readers who don't work with narrative theory to more formally isolate the four major elements of narration/storyworld/plot/character under their own subheader prior to this section as well. These are minor and highly subjective, however.[footnote]This is very much appreciated! The glossaries are my primary focus with our work on WonderCat this summer and I'm eager to maximize their usefulness.[/footnote]</em>

<em>As a side note: in the preface, it’s worth noting that the link for "a workshop designed to help faculty prepare to teach literature without a reading list” currently leads to a limited-time sign up, so will presumably need to change in the final version</em>. <strong>-Reviewer 5</strong>

<em>The expandable parts of the later sections were helpful to see the overall subtopics before expanding individual sections. It would be easier to navigate if there were a way to collapse the expanded sections from the bottom. More helpful would be a way to move from one chapter to the next without going back to the top, since when each section is expanded, the page is quite lengthy.</em>
<em>It would be helpful to have additional linking within the text. I mentioned earlier linking to the first project when later projects refer to that project's instructions. Additionally, linking to the glossaries and/or to WonderCat at each mention would be useful.</em>
<em>I would find it helpful to read a brief description of each of these courses in the "How Does This Work?" section, perhaps starting with the course description and then explaining what each does differently. That would mean that I could better understand the rationale for the differences across the four courses. It could also establish an expectation for anyone else modding this book to do something similar for whatever they add to the approach. These could be added to the book in future editions if social annotation were turned on for commenting from anyone adopting the book's approach.</em>
<em>In the section detailing a typical class, it would be useful to know how long a class period is, and how many class sessions there are per semester. Also, if this course has been designed for fully on-site learning in a semester, what considerations or adjustments might someone make when teaching this as a hybrid, online synchronous, online asynchronous, trimester, quarter, summer session, once-per-week, etc. This might be as simple as acknowledging the timing and modality of these examples, and could additionally benefit from a list of suggestions to shift the course into a different timing or modality. I would not expect a different version of any of these courses, but as instructors implement this approach, they might share their experiences teaching in these different situations.[footnote]I love these ideas and will work on folding this in as we get submissions for the next edition. For now, I have added more internal linking.[/footnote]</em>
<em>I love the idea of inviting students to have a shared imaginative experience, but I don't think my students would read "Welcome to the Station"--and I don't know that I wouldn't lose them reading it aloud in class. I might need to shorten it to keep their attention. <strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong></em>

<em>The book was organized logically into meaningful and accessible sections. I found it easy to navigate. -</em><strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Caly Poly San Luis Obispo</strong>

<em>The text is clear and logical. It doesn't feel like it has a satisfying conclusion, however. It just sort of ... ends. The preface is a great introduction and really sets the scene, but there's no takeaway, and I miss that. There ought to be more opportunity for reflection, thinking about the implications of these assignments, thinking about possibilities for adaptation, bringing the praxis back to theories, etc. The end of the text felt quite abrupt.</em><strong> -Reviewer 4</strong>

<em>The topics are presented in a logical, clear fashion. I do recommend a little more signposting at the start to explain what is consistent/repeated in each sample course (ex. “The Station”) and what is changed.</em><strong> -Reviewer 3</strong>

<em>I think the organization of Searching for Wonder works well. I am personally of the old school when it comes to books. I like to hold them and see them as a completed thing, share them and borrow them and read comments in the margins. Archaic, I know! But I completely recognize the limitations of those relics in a digital age.</em>

<em>I am impressed with how this book integrates external links, databases, examples of previous student work, and the very ambitious WonderCat project. All of it signals a serious attention to the digital humanities and learning that, in my personal opinion, is needed with the rise of digital learning and AI technologies in particular.</em>

<em>It also shows that books like these can continue to grow and evolve even while they are published, and those developments rely on the activity of learning and thinking of real people. It's a counter-point to the ed-tech turn that seeks to remove human engagement from the classroom.</em>

<em>Organizationally, it is very ambitious. And at the same time, it's clear and accessible. Congrats to the author and publisher for innovating on this years old topic of teaching and learning through literature.</em> <strong>-Reviewer 2</strong>

The text is well-organized, though it does seem less like a book that makes an academic argument (as I'm accustomed to encountering) and more like a pedagogy guide that includes useful materials for teachers who find themselves drawn to Isbell's approach. <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>The Contents section is easy to navigate and flows well.</em>

<em>The “Glossary of Narrative Technologies” is well organized, providing cross-reference guidance for students with the categories: Term; Definition; Synonyms; Sort by Narration; Sort by Plot; Sort by Storyworld; Sort by Character</em><strong> -Reviewer 1</strong>

<em>I found this digital edition both exciting and overwhelming. It's exciting to see all the opportunities made possible and seized because of the digital platform. I loved the fact that there is a link to a workshop led by Isbell and Fletcher (and free!!); this sort of offering could make this text even more inviting to any professors who might consider undertaking this approach to teaching. The links out to assignments within the more global discussions of this pedagogical approach were great too. WONDERCAT itself is fascinating--a real invitation into a rabbit hole!! All that said, there is an overwhelming nature to it. I worried at points that I was perhaps missing sections and other times I felt that I was given too much repetition. Rather than picking up on my reference to "repetition" there, however, I would suggest offering a little more explanation of how to use this digital edition. Some of that explanation could simply be a more explicit identification of what all people can find in the text. I know the TOC does that, but something short could be helpful. More importantly, suggestions about how a user (interested in different goals, like just exploring assignments or just looking at terminology, etc.) might most efficiently use the text could be helpful. Beyond such explanation of the text as a whole, I needed more explanation of how to navigate WONDERCAT. <strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong></em>
<h2>Please select how likely you are to use some aspect of this book in future literature courses. What do you think about this book overall?</h2>
<em>Extremely Likely; As a reader, I am grateful for the innovative approach to literature in Searching for Wonder. The refreshing way it approaches student disengagement will become increasingly important as we encourage students to love literature and reading. I am especially grateful for how this book has called me to reconsider my own stance toward literature and my students. I now need to think more deeply about what it means to be formed by a book if literary techniques are kinds of technology. My main question is "What do we do after experiencing wonder?" Once we've had that experience alone while reading or together in the flow of a classroom discussion, where do we point students next? The assignments in this book and the public-facing examples of student work begin to answer that question, but I think it's something for all of us who adopt these strategies to consider further.</em> <strong>-Dr. Christopher Adamson; Director, Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching; Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</strong>

<em>Extremely Likely; Letting students explore "new-to-them" texts in the classroom—and through the lens of how and why they have the experiences that they do—hopefully both empowers students and boosts their appreciation for narrative media. The flexibility of the student-selected text approach is certainly borne out in example projects that include responses to comics and video games in addition to more standard literature and film texts.</em>
<em>In particular, the combination of "Strategies for Teaching Literature with Student-Selected Texts," the various sample courses in "Assignments in Context," and the excellent digital glossaries and linked resources open up a broad range of possibilities for customizing a course according to a given idea, theme, or period. I appreciate the author's tips on running this type of course (e.g., telling students not to just write reviews, suggested activity sequences divided among narrative elements) as well as the generosity of the students who shared their work; I look forward to seeing the "Story and the Brain" examples added in the near future! I can already see myself drawing upon classification &amp; description exercises, using the glossaries to help students articulate their experiences, and overall refining my approach to getting students to talk about narrative. I may be subject to the scrutiny of my department when it comes to syllabus approval, but these assignment and discussion ideas can easily find their way into the classroom.</em>
<em>My suggestions were minor; though it's possible some reviewers who are less familiar with narrative theory or who have not read Wonderworks might need to take more time understanding what "narrative technologies" are or how they relate to story experiences, I think the author presents a clear and helpful way of enriching students' relationships with narrative media. In the age of ChatGPT, TikTok, and other challenges to student writing and engagement, having a resource available that highlights individual experience and experimentation with narratives is a wonderful guide in a changing academic landscape</em>. <strong>-Reviewer 5</strong>

<em>Extremely Likely; The book offers an exciting way to approach teaching literature to students in a way that gives them more agency, strengthening their observation and description skills, while asking them to consider categories of experiences and tools that can connect different narratives and different readers.</em>

<em>The approach, with its emphasis on student interest and de-emphasis on grading, will help motivate student engagement and confidence.</em>

<em>In addition to wanting to try these techniques to collaborate with students on gathering content for WonderCat, I am especially interested in the variety of approaches to the culmination of the semester, which asks students to display their semester-long learning for a larger audience either physically on campus or virtually as an OpenLab installation.</em>

<em>Although I can see the hesitation some instructors would have with the lack of coverage of the literary canon, I can see the value of this approach in gen-ed courses that do not need to include an exhaustive list of texts from a given period or movement.</em> <em><strong>-Dr. Jody R. Rosen, Associate Professor, New York City College of Technology</strong></em>

<em>Extremely Likely; Searching for Wonder is framed as a gift rather than a mandate. It is an answer to a question that many instructors, not just Isbell, have had: How can we get our students to read? This book does not just provide a gimmick, a carrot, a software, or a philosophy, but rather an entire set of materials, tools, and instruction manuals.</em>

<em>The book privileges two concepts of learning that are important to me and that I have been thinking about recently.</em>

<em>The first is play. How can we make learning more like play for our students? For those of us who have always found joy in our educational institutions, each course, each text was an adventure. In this book, Isbell intentionally builds a playful and imaginative framing device around the course to help her students experience the sense of adventure she feels when reading and learning.</em>

<em>The second concept I have been reflecting on appears in Isbell's opening narrative about the train station. She states, “Nobody is in a hurry.” This is what our students need to hear. Learning isn’t about efficiency. Isbell gives her students, who have been conditioned to produce “deliverables,” permission to not finish the book, to slow down, to focus on their experiences and their connections to the experiences of others.</em>

<em>I look forward to using the content in this book as soon as I can. -<strong>Dr. Lauren R. Beck, Lecturer, Caly Poly San Luis Obispo</strong></em>

<em>Moderately Likely; I think the text is a good start. What's here is useful and really thoughtful. As a collection of assignments and an approach to a course, it's good stuff. As a text, though, it feels undercooked. I couldn't help but think, "Is that it?" at the end.</em>

<em>The WonderCat chapter is much too short. I spent some time trying to figure the tool out and was completely befuddled. I just don't get it. I'm also wary of this kind of hypertaxonomizing. I really responded negatively, in a visceral way, to that approach. It's the greatest weakness of the text for me: both the impenetrability of the tool and the weirdly (to me) technocratic approach to literature it seems to imply. It's the only really off-putting note here for me.[footnote]Noted. WonderCat will not be for everyone! I've clarified in the WonderCat section that this is an experimental tool and proposed some ways of accomplishing the goals of this approach without it.[/footnote] <strong>-</strong></em><strong>Reviewer 4</strong>

<em>Moderately Likely; This book is both charming and provocative, modest and radical, fun and earnest. I enjoyed reading it and thinking about how the innovative and humane assignments would engage my students. I can imagine *adapting* practices in future classes.</em>

<em>I share the author’s concern with our many challenges as literature professors (mentioned and alluded to here): AI, declines in reading, and a devaluing of both higher ed and expertise in the US. I am also concerned about the challenge posed by a digital world that disconnects us from one another and pushes folks into their own corners of fandom and factionalism. I am a little but wary that this curriculum actually does little to counter *that*. <strong>-Reviewer 3</strong></em>

<em>Extremely likely; Overall, I am delighted by the project and its reach and innovation. I hope it will find its way to teachers who are looking for ways to foster creativity, curiosity, and exploration during this transitional period of tech, of disrupted educational spaces due to the pandemic, and of misinformation and "alternative" truths. I look forward to seeing it continue to evolve, too</em>. <strong>-Reviewer 2</strong>

<em>Moderately likely; Isbell's book reflects the immense labor and creative work that she has put in to developing a new way of teaching literature to students who don't necessarily do the reading. This book will help undergraduate instructors give students the sense of autonomy and self-motivation that they need to become committed readers.</em> <strong>-Dr. Amanda Auerbach, Assistant Professor, The Catholic University of America</strong>

<em>Extremely likely; “The most important thing, I think, is that we encourage students to search for wonder in whatever period or genre we are teaching. The second most important thing is that we give them the tools to make sense of their experiences reading.”</em>

<em>One of the first tenets of education is, teach the students in front of you. The omission being, not the students from the previous semester, your colleague’s classes, ten years ago, etc. You meet the students in the “Information Age," give them structure juxtaposed with space, and tools complimented by student-contribution &amp; analysis. This is a creative, thoughtful, and empowering approach to teaching literature and inspiring a sense of wonder within the student-selected texts, and further still, in the students’ hearts and minds.</em>

<em>“If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder … he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement, and mystery of the world we live in.” — Rachel Carson</em>

<em>Your efforts and this book have the possibility of fostering each subsequent educator into becoming that “adult.” </em><strong>-Reviewer 1</strong>

Extremely likely; This book is inspiring. It speaks with the voice of an amazing professor who is open, realistic, daring, and genuinely interested in their students. The Preface alone embodies those qualities and thus perfectly invites other professors into Isbell's work. As I explored the class and assignment descriptions, the commitment to students as active and engaged became increasingly apparent. It exudes most from the assignments that give students (and professors, who, in this pedagogical design, get to become students alongside their "official" students) agency to create and expand the discussion of literature. Many of those assignments were designed in ways to engage people beyond the classroom and thereby foster what, I see, as a goal of any professor and/or any academic institution: inspiring curiosity.
This book is also helpful in very practical ways. It offers example upon example of assignments (and/or introductions to assignments and class "philosophies" and goals) that any professor could adapt for themselves (even if they were not ready/willing to yet move away from their assigned reading list). It explicitly invites that adaptation, and while the voice is unique in all of the explanations and assignments, they are composed in a way that I see them as inherently malleable.
As this text is inspired by Angus Fletcher's work (perhaps written in tandem with Fletcher), it could be helpful to have an overview of his work/theories early in the text. There is some discussion there but for those new to it or with just a thumbnail knowledge of it, a little more background could be a helpful foundation. Full disclosure: I am one with a thumbnail knowledge and found myself wanting more to ground me. <em><strong>-Dr. Laura Elizabeth Rotunno, Associate Professor of English, Penn State Altoona</strong></em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Day by Day

Day 1:
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss assignment prompt (read in advance, ideally annotated with student questions)</li>
 	<li>Discuss example post (also read in advance, with students encouraged to explore citations and bring passages for discussion)</li>
 	<li>Conclude with guidance on hunting for a text. Students share things they’re interested in (places, events, genres, issues, literary techniques) and the class makes recommendations</li>
</ul>
Day 2: Discuss first impressions of chosen text and build strategies for working through difficulty

Day 3: Discuss reading experience section of post (due before class)

Day 4: Discuss draft character (due before class)

&nbsp;

Prompt for Character Assignment

For this third assignment, I want you to share your experience encountering a new character through written text. Think of your post as an account of your journey exploring this literary work (or a summary of your findings). There is no requirement to have a single argument or claim. You are not required to find peer-reviewed sources to support or contextualize what you want to say. There is no requirement to be original. I want you to let your interests guide you and share your experiences, questions, and theories with your classmates.

Create a character...focus on autobiography

Put a person you know really well in another storyworld

Unique thing about this character you’ve never seen in another person

One episode in this character’s life that would help someone understand the character

What character from another work of literature would really get along with this character

<strong>Featured Image</strong>

Your featured image can represent the content of your post in a wide range of ways. The image can be a book cover, an image of a page, or fan art inspired by one of the works you’re writing about. If you include a play or film script, perhaps an image from the production or the movie poster. You might also want to create something new to use as your featured image. Make sure that you include complete media file details for your featured image (“caption” and “alternative text” fields). Please also include the URL for the image file in the “description” field.

&nbsp;

<strong>Experiencing Character</strong>

Describe your experience reading (or listening to an audio recording of) of character in any written text published between 1789 and 1914 that you haven’t read before (we'll go over strategies for searching). This should be something brand new to you, which means that you will very likely by looking for context as you read so you can understand unfamiliar words and makes sense of a storyworld that is not familiar. Focus on describing your experience reading with as much detail as possible. Incorporate specific passages that prompted a response from you, whether that response is related to enjoyment of the text or frustration about being confused by the text. Make sure to keep track of all of the sources you reference as you read (Wikipedia articles, dictionary definitions, article on the Internet, blog posts, scholarly sources, etc.). Reading a text written before you were born can be challenging! We will go over strategies that can help you make sense of the unfamiliar.

<strong>Create a Character</strong>

You can include both your thought process as you try to create this character (ideas you considered but discarded even), but make sure to try to actually write a section of a totally new story that includes the character you have created.]]></content:encoded>
